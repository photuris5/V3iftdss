        <p>Landscape “0” defines the landscape extent through the rest of the comparison process. You may also use it to represent your existing landscape if desired, or edit it in the next step (editing)&#160;to represent your Existing Condition (EC). You may also work from any other available files that match the extent of landscape "0".</p>
