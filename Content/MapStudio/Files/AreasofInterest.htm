        <h1>The Shapefile - aka Area of Interest, Mask, or Polygon<img src="../../Resources/Images/shapefiles_names.png" alt="mugshot background with a polygon" style="width: 381px;height: 274px;float: right;" /></h1>
        <p>A shapefile is a simple non-topographical way to store geometric location and attribute information for landscape features; they are often used to represent treatment areas, burn units, and other disturbances or treatments. Shapefiles can be used for many purposes in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />, and depending on what you use them for, you may see them referred to by different names.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Area of Interest</b>: When generating a new landscape or a summary from an existing landscape, you may specify an area of interest (shapefile) to represent a particular part of your landscape. </li>
            <li><b>Mask/ Landscape Mask</b>: When editing a landscape you may choose a Mask or Landscape Mask (Shapefile) to edit only the area within that mask.</li>
            <li><b>Polygon</b>: In the Edit Tools button of <MadCap:variable name="General.MapStudio" />, you will see shapefiles referred to as polygons</li>
        </ul>
