        <p>As part of the process of predicting the potential behavior and effects of wildland fires, forest/fire scientists have developed fire behavior fuel models: sets of information on the fuelbed inputs to be used in specific fire behavior or fire effects models (Rothermel, <a href="../../15_References/References.htm#Rothermel1972">1972</a>; Rothermel, <a href="../../15_References/References.htm#Rothermel1983">1983</a>; Anderson, <a href="../../15_References/References.htm#Anderson1982">1982</a>; Scott and Burgan, <a href="../../15_References/References.htm#Scottandburgan2005">2005</a>).</p>
        <p>These collections of fuel properties are sometimes referred to more briefly as fuel models, though we prefer to refer to them as fire behavior fuel models because there are other kinds of fuel models that are used for other purposes.</p>
        <p>The fire behavior fuel models are classified into four groups—grasses, brush (or shrubs), timber, and slash.  The differences in fire behavior among these groups are basically related to the fuel load and its distribution among the fuel particle size classes (Anderson, 1982).</p>
        <p>The fire behavior modules used in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> require these descriptions of fuel properties as input parameters, which are then used to calculate fire behavior potentials.</p>
        <p>The following tables are provided in support of the surface fire behavior modules:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="FBFMSummaries.htm">A summary table of individual fire behavior fuel models</a>, with a photograph of a typical environment for each model.</li>
            <li><a href="../fuel_model_moistrs.htm">A table</a> providing information on the moisture input(s) required for each of these models.</li>
            <li><a href="../heat_values.htm">A table</a> providing values for heat per unit area for some of the original 13 fire behavior fuel models.</li>
            <li><a href="../live_fuel_moistr_estmt.htm">Two tables</a> providing guidelines and information on moisture content and curing levels in fuels.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In these tables (and in the industry), Anderson's original 13 fire behavior fuel models are referred to as FM 1 through FM&#160;13 (or sometimes just 1 through 13); Scott and Burgan's additional 40 fire behavior fuel models are named with letter and number combinations. With the Scott and Burgan models, the letters represent the predominant fuel as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>GR = grass</li>
            <li>GS = grass-shrub</li>
            <li>NB = nonburnable</li>
            <li>SH = shrub</li>
            <li>SB = slash-blowdown</li>
            <li>TL = timber litter</li>
            <li>TU = timber-understory</li>
        </ul>
