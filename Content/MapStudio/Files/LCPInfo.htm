        <h1>Landscape (.lcp) Files</h1>
        <p>A Landscape file (.lcp) is a multi-band raster format commonly used by wildland fire behavior and fire effects models such as FARSITE and FlamMap. The bands of an .LCP file store data describing terrain, tree canopy, and fuel model. The .lcp files used by <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> contain information describing:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Aspect</li>
            <li>Canopy base height</li>

        <p>In <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />, a Landscape file is the basic file needed to define your project area and run most of the modeling operations. In the <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> application, and in many places throughout these help documents, we refer to 'creating a .lcp file'. During this process, you are actually downloading the .lcp file for your chosen area from <a href="../../References/LANDFIRE.htm">LANDFIRE</a>.</p>
        <p>There are multiple places in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> where Landscape files from which Landscape files may be created. Visit the <a href="LCPCreate.htm">Create Landscapes Topic</a> for a list of methods and step by step details.</p>
