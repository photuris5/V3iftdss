        <h1>Swipe</h1>
        <p>During various analyses you may want to visually compare two landscapes, or compare model run outputs such as fire behavior with various landscape attributes.. This is where the <span class="UIcomponent">Swipe</span> <img src="../../Resources/Images/mapstudio/button_slider.png" alt="swipe button" /> tool comes in handy. The <span class="UIcomponent">Swipe</span> tool allows you to click and drag a bar across the <MadCap:variable name="General.MapStudio" /> screen to view layer interactions.</p>
        <p>To use the tool, select <span class="UIcomponent">Swipe</span> <img src="../../Resources/Images/mapstudio/button_slider.png" alt="swipe button" /> from the top right of <MadCap:variable name="General.MapStudio" />.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/mapstudio/swipe_image04.png" style="width: 520px;height: 236px;" alt="the swipe button is located in the top right of the map" />
        </p>
        <p>Choose the layers you wish to swipe between. You may swipe between masks/polygons, landscapes, or model runs outputs.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <div class="noteIFTDSS" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">Layers and features must already be turned on <MadCap:variable name="General.MapStudio" /> either via the <span class="UIcomponent"><a href="LayerList.htm">layer list</a></span> or <span class="UIcomponent"><a href="SimulationTools.htm">simulation Tools</a></span> buttons before they are visible in the <span class="UIcomponent">Swipe </span>dropdown menu.</div>
        <h2>Example of Comparing Two Different Landscapes</h2>
        <p>This is an example of <span class="UIcomponent">Swipe</span> used to compare a base landscape to an edited landscape. The upper portion of the image shows the edited landscape where rules were created to change the current fuel model to fuel model with lower flame length to account for a previous fire/burn through the area.</p>

        </p>
        <h2>Example of Comparing a Landscape to Model Run Output</h2>
        <p>This is an example of <span class="UIcomponent">Swipe</span> used to compare a edited landscape to an associated model run. The upper portion of the image shows the edited landscape and the lower portion of the image shows the associated model run. This tool can be helpful to use when doing landscape critiquing or model run calibrating.</p>
