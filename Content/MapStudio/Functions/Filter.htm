This can be useful if you are working in an area with many shapefiles (such as many treatments clustered in a small area, or overlapping each other). Only the polygons that meet the expression criteria will be visible in the map.<img src="../../Resources/Images/mapstudio/filter_edit.png" alt="filter editor with a list of polygons to filter selected" /></p>
        <p>To add a filter, first go to the Edit Filter tab. At the highest level you can Filter by Folder and then Filter by Name.  When Filter by Folder is set to All Folders, all of your shapefiles will be listed. When a specific folder is selected using the pick-list, only those within the folder are listed.</p>
        <p>By default all of the shapefiles are selected for filtering. To change the selection press <span class="UIcomponent">Select</span> <img src="../../Resources/Images/mapstudio/filtereditbutton.png" alt="filter select button" />to activate the ability to select and unselect the individual shapefiles. If you would like to select all the shapefiles click the <span class="UIcomponent">Select All</span><img src="../../Resources/Images/mapstudio/filtercheckbutton.png" alt="filter select all button" /> button, or to deselect all selected shapefiles click the Deselect <img src="../../Resources/Images/mapstudio/filterxbutton.png" alt="filter deselect button" />button. After you have selected the shapefiles you would like to display click <span class="UIcomponent">Apply Filter</span> <img src="../../Resources/Images/mapstudio/filterapply.png" alt="apply filter button" />.</p>
        <p>To remove your filter and have all shapefile display in Map Studio simply press<span class="UIcomponent"> Remove Filter</span> <img src="../../Resources/Images/mapstudio/filterremove.png" alt="filter remove button" />.</p>
