        <p>The <MadCap:variable name="General.MapStudio" /><span class="UIcomponent">Filter button</span> <img src="../../Resources/Images/mapstudio/button_filter.png" alt="filter button" /> allows you to limit the visibility of polygons or shapefiles when working in <MadCap:variable name="General.MapStudio" />. This can be useful if you are working on in an area with many shapefiles (such as many treatments clustered in a small area, or overlapping each other) <img src="../../Resources/Images/mapstudio/filter.png" alt="field to filter by folder and name with button at the bottom to apply filter to your map" style="float: right;width: 297px;height: 333px;" />Only the polygons that meet the expression criteria will be visible in the map. You can apply  a filter by folder, or by name.</p>
