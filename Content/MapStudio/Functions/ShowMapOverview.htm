        <h1>Map Overview</h1>
        <p>During your work in <MadCap:variable name="General.MapStudio" /> you may want to stay zoomed-in to a specific extent, but move to a part of the map that is outside of your current viewing area. <span class="UIcomponent">Map Overview</span> <img src="../../Resources/Images/mapstudio/button_overview.png" alt="overview button" />displays the current extent of the map while letting you move the map viewing window to other locations.</p>
        <p>Selecting <span class="UIcomponent">Map Overview</span> in the upper right-hand corner will bring up a small screen showing you current extent, represented by a darkened rectangle, in the context of a much greater map area. By dragging this rectangle with the mouse, you may change your map viewing area while retaining your present mapping extent.  This screen will stay active until <span class="UIcomponent">Map Overview</span> is selected again. </p>

        <div class="noteIFTDSS" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">You may still <span class="UIcomponent">zoom in</span> and <span class="UIcomponent">out </span>while <span class="UIcomponent">Map Overview</span> is turned on, to aid in general geospatial navigation.</div>
