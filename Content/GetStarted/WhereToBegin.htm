                <p>The new <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> is laid out slightly different than past versions of <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />. <MadCap:variable name="General.MapStudio" /> is still present and has been updated. <a href="../MapStudio/Functions/MapFunctions.htm">About <MadCap:variable name="General.MapStudio" /></a></p>
                <p>Information is stored in two main locations in the new <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="../MyWorkspace/MyWorkspaceAbout.htm">My Workspace</a> is where all your landscape files and reports are stored. You may organize your workspace by creating or deleting folders for your project information.</li>
                    <li><a href="../ModelingPG/ModelsOverview.htm">Modeling Playground</a> is the area of <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> in which models are run, and modeling outputs are stored. You may choose models to run, proceed to populating and running models, view a list of completed modeling runs, and select completed modeling runs to view output summaries or spatial outputs in <MadCap:variable name="General.MapStudio" />.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>&#160;</p>
                <h2>Organization</h2>
                <p>You'll notice something we refer to as the '<a href="../00-Concepts/PlanningCycleAbout.htm">Planning Cycle</a>' in this version of <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />. This is a guided interface that walks you through the process of specific fuels planning tasks using <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />.</p>
                <h2>Capabilities</h2>
                <p>Our development team has focused efforts on maximizing fire behavior and landscape evaluation capabilities. Because of this you may certain options in the application are grayed out, or not listed. Throughout 2017, 2018, and beyond the development team will be adding functionality, models, and reporting capabilities - grayed-out content is gradually become available, and new features, not yet visible will be announced too.</p>
