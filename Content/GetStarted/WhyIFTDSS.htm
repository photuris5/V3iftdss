        <h1>Why use <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> for Fuel Planning?</h1>
        <p>The <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> online application is designed to make the fuels planning and management process easier by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Providing place to store and edit your landscape and run models online, from any computer, anywhere</li>
            <li>Integrating many common fire behavior and effects models in a single user interface</li>
            <li>Linking to common reporting databases to more easily access and submit planning information</li>
            <li>Exporting results, reports, tables, and files for use in the fuels planning documentation and further analysis</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Over the span of 2017, 2018, and beyond, additional capabilities will be added to <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> with the goal of eventually offering all the tools needed by the fire management community to conduct fire and fuels planning</p>
