            <ul>
                <li> The Compare in Summary Report option does not become available until the landscapes and/or model outputs have finished processing.</li>
                <li>Comparison reports are only available for 2 landscapes at a time. Selecting more than 2 landscapes at once will only proved a "View on Map" option, and only for the landscapes and outputs will be viewable in the Layer List.</li>
                <li>If you want to compare the same two landscapes/outputs in reverse order you will need to delete the previously created Compare report in your workspace, reselect the landscapes in reverse order and create a new report.</li>
