            <MadCap:keyword term="FlamMap" />FlamMap Fire Behavior Inputs</h1>
        <p>In conjunction with a landscape file you select, fire behavior is driven by the inputs below. You also have the option of selecting either the Finney method or the Scott and Reinhardt method for calculating crown fire potential. See <a href="FlamMapCrown.htm">Crown Fire Calculations Options</a> for a comparison of these two methods.</p>
