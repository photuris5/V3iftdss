            <MadCap:keyword term="Minimum Travel Time Tab" />Minimum Travel Time Tab</h1>
        <p>The minimum travel time (MTT) feature is a two-dimensional fire growth 
 model (Finney, 2002). It calculates fire growth and behavior by searching 
 for the set of pathways with minimum fire spread times from point, line 
 or polygon ignition sources. In theory, the results are identical to wave-front 
 expansion used in <span class="span_2">FARSITE</span> with 
 the exception that all weather and fuel moisture conditions are held constant 
 over time with MTT but are allowed to vary with time in <span class="span_2">FARSITE</span>.</p>

 toolbar button to locate the position of the fire at the beginning of 
 the simulations before you open the "Runs" dialog box. Point,

        <h3>
            <MadCap:keyword term="Ignition:Random" /><a name="RandomIgnitions" id="RandomIgnitions"></a>Random</h3>
        <p>In addition to calculating fire growth for single or multiple ignitions, 
 MTT can be used to <a href="../Tech_Topics/Tech_MTT.htm#BurnProbability"><MadCap:keyword term="Burn Probabilities" />compute 
 burn probabilities</a> for a specified number of randomly located ignition 
 points each of a constant duration. Selecting the <span class="Code-Command">Random</span> 
 radio button requires an additional input for the <span class="Code-Command">Number 
 of Random Ignitions:</span> spin box. The default number of 100 ignitions 
 is likely too low for most landscapes. Considerations when determining 
 the number of random ignitions to use;</p>
        <ul class="ul_2">
            <li class="p">
                <p>Setting the number of ignitions requires some trial 
	 and error, for best results the output map should contain only minor 
	 amounts of zero probability, ideally only the non-burnable areas.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="p">
                <p>Since the size of each random ignition (thus it's 
	 contribution to the probability) also depends on fire duration, specified 
	 in the <span class="Code-Command"><a href="#MaxSimTime">Maximum Simulation 
	 Time</a></span> spin box, simulation times may affect results if a 
	 relativity small number of ignitions is used.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="p">
                <p>Larger landscapes will require more ignitions than 
	 smaller ones.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="p">
                <p>Landscapes with faster rates of spread will need fewer 
	 ignitions than "slower" landscapes of the same size.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="p">
                <p>Since the ignitions are random, separate runs with 
	 the same inputs will give different results.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="p">
                <p>Numbers of ignitions greater than that needed to burn 
	 the entire landscape do not significantly change the results (differences 
	 do occur with the random variability of the ignitions) but do increase 
	 processing times.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Burn probabilities provide one method of evaluating the effectiveness 
 of fuel treatments that removes the uncertainty of ignition sources. A 
 large sample size of ignitions (say 1000’s or 10,000’s) on the treated 
 and pre-treatment landscape gives an indication of the overall effectiveness 
 of the landscape pattern in retarding the growth of large fires. To do 
 this type of analysis you will need to create different Landscape (.LCP) 
 Files that reflect the different treatments in terms of the five fuel 
 themes. If <span class="Code-Command">Random</span> ignitions are selected 
 only Burn Probabilities, Perimeters, FLP, and Fire Size List outputs are 
 available.</p>
        <p>Note: this process is very CPU intensive when simulating fire growth 
 from thousands of random ignitions. This is best performed on multi-processor 
 computers or when long computing times are acceptable.</p>
        <h3>
            <MadCap:keyword term="Fire Size List" />
            <MadCap:keyword term="Ignition:List File" /><a name="From_Fire_List_File"></a>From Fire List File</h3>
        <p>Burn probabilities can also be computed from a previously defined list 
 of fires contained in a text file. This <a href="../FileTypes/Fire_Size_List_File.htm">Fire 
 List File</a> is typically generated from a previous MTT run using random 
 ignitions or a FSim large fire simulator run and is named the FireSizeList 
 (because it also contain information on the sizes of the random fires).</p>
        <p>Computing burn probabilities from a fixed list of fires eliminates the 
 variability between runs caused by the random selection of ignitions. 
 This can be an advantage when comparing burn probability results from 
 runs using different input parameters. Make sure the list of fires is 
 large enough to give good burn probabilities - typically most of the burnable 
 landscape should end up with a burn probability greater than zero. &#160;</p>
        <h2><a name="MTTparameters" id="MTTparameters"></a>Inputs</h2>
        <p>To use the minimum travel time feature, you must supply several inputs 
 in addition to those required for basic fire behavior computation (i.e. 
 initial fuel moisture file, wind speed and wind direction). These additional 
 inputs include:</p>
        <h3><a name="NodeResolution" id="NodeResolution"></a>Resolution of the calculations</h3>
        <p>This is independent of the resolution of the landscape data and dictates 
 the spacing of nodes used to calculate minimum travel times and output 
 grids. Below is shown a 30m fuel grid overlaid with a 60m node resolution. 
 MTT performs the fire behavior calculations at the nodes.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../flammaprobo_supporing/NodeResolution.gif" alt="Node overladed on fuel model grid" title="Node overladed on fuel model grid" width="674" height="511" border="0" class="img_1" />
        </p>
        <p>This setting is the most significant way to control the computational 
 intensity (i.e. run time) of your simulation. For example, doubling the 
 resolution from 30m to 60m would decrease run time by 75% since there 
 would be only 25% of the nodes to preform calculations on. However setting 
 the resolution greater than the Landscape (.LCP) File cell size will cause 
 some of the cells to be "skipped over" for the calculations. 
 Setting the resolution smaller than the cell size provides no additional 
 precision and only increases the computation time.</p>
        <p>The Resolution distance units (meters, feet, or kilometers) are the 
 Grid Distance Units of the Landscape (.LCP) File.</p>
        <h3><a name="MaxSimTime" id="MaxSimTime"></a>Maximum Simulation Time</h3>
        <p>This specifies the duration (in minutes) of the fire growth calculations 
 for the set of constant fuel moisture and wind conditions entered on the 
 <span class="Code-Command"><a href="Inputs_Tab.htm">Inputs</a></span> 
 tab. For example, if you want to simulate a fire for three days where 
 the burning period is five hours/day (for which you specified maximum 
 burning period conditions), enter 900 minutes. (3 days x 5 hours/day x 
 60 minute/hour)</p>
        <p>A "0" (zero) simulation time indicates that you want to run 
 the simulation until all burnable nodes on the landscape have "burned". 
 On "slow" landscapes or with moderate weather conditions this 
 can cause very long runtimes. Also be very careful if considering using 
 this option with the <span class="Code-Command">Random</span> ignitions 
 feature.</p>
        <h3><a name="PathInterval" id="PathInterval"></a>Interval for Minimum Travel 
 Paths</h3>
        <p>This controls how the program selects and outputs the MTT Major Paths 
 at a specified distance interval. Shown below are 600m (left)and 300m 
 intervals for the major paths. This setting changes only the display of 
 the Major Paths, it does not affect the calculation of the Influence Grid, 
 from which the Major Paths are derived.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../flammaprobo_supporing/MajorPaths1.png" alt="Major paths at 300m and 600m resolutions" title="Major paths at 300m and 600m resolutions" width="653" height="325" border="0" class="img_1" />
        </p>
        <p>The Interval distance units (meters, feet, or kilometers) are the Grid 
 Distance Units of the Landscape (.LCP) File.</p>
        <h3>
            <MadCap:keyword term="Spotting" /><a name="Spot_Probability"></a>Spot Probability</h3>
        <p>Launching embers from every crown fire node can be computationally intensive, 
 resulting in a long running simulation which often doesn't change results. 
 The <span class="Code-Command">Spot Probability:</span> setting controls 
 how many of the nodes where <a href="../Tech_Topics/Tech_Crown_Fire.htm">crown 
 fire is initiated</a> actually launch embers which can start new fires. 
 A setting of 1.00 will compute a spot distance and direction for each 
 crown fire node and a setting of 0.00 will prevent any spot fires. Settings 
 between 0.01 and 1.00 proportionally control how many crown fire nodes 
 launch a spot. See <a href="../Tech_Topics/Spotting.htm">Spotting (technical 
 documentation)</a> for more information.</p>
        <p><span class="span_3">NOTE:</span> Users will probably want 
 to set “spotting probability” higher for FlamMap than for <span class="span_2">FARSITE</span> 
 or NTFB fire simulators.</p>
        <h3>
            <MadCap:keyword term="Spotting" /><a name="Spotting_Delay"></a>Spotting Delay</h3>
        <p>The <span class="Code-Command">Spotting Delay:</span> setting is the 
 time delay between when a ember lands on a burnable node and it begins 
 to spread. This is typically set between 0-60 minutes with shorter delays 
 associated with drier burning conditions.</p>
        <h3><a name="Search_Depths"></a>Lateral &amp; Vertical Search Depths</h3>
        <p>When searching for the fastest path MTT cannot realistically look at 
 every possible path between nodes. To limit how far MTT searches for a 
 faster path the <span class="Code-Command">Lateral</span> &amp; <span class="Code-Command">Vertical Search Depth</span>s control how long 
 MTT will look for a faster (lower arrival time) node. </p>
        <p>These search depths are actually thresholds for sequentially failing 
 to find a faster arrival time. For example, if the lateral search depth 
 is set to "3", MTT will keep searching farther and farther to 
 the right or left from the starting point, as long as it succeeds in finding 
 the fastest path, until it fails 3 times in sequence. Larger values will 
 cause longer computation times because it will require more sequential 
 failures before it gives up in a given direction. The way the algorithm 
 is structured, the lateral search depth is better set higher than the 
 vertical search depth (require more rows before failure than columns).</p>
        <p>For homogeneous landscapes, larger values will increase the chance that 
 the fastest paths are found between cells (nodes) with farther separation. 
 In other words, MTT will be more accurate. For very heterogeneous landscapes 
 (e.g. every cell has different spread rates or maximum spread directions) 
 then the settings for search depths will matter much less.</p>
        <p>Default values for normal use are: Vertical = 4 and lateral = 6. To 
 increase speed or for very heterogeneous landscapes, settings might be 
 reduced to Vertical = 2 and Lateral = 3.</p>
        <h3>Wind direction (on the Inputs Tab)</h3>
        <p>When using the MTT feature one of the <a href="Inputs_Tab.htm#Winds"><span class="Code-Command">Winds</span> radio buttons</a> should be selected 
 on the <span class="Code-Command">Inputs</span> tab. This wind direction 
 should reflect the results of a separate wind analysis done to find the 
 prevailing wind speeds and directions.</p>
        <h2>
            <MadCap:keyword term="Barriers" /><a name="Barriers"></a>Barriers</h2>
        <p>Shapefiles can be used in FlamMap runs to simulate barriers to fire 
 spread that may not be represented in the landscape. For instance, if 
 you know that a creek or road is a barrier to surface fire spread, but 
 landscape data show that some or all of the cells are burnable in the 
 area represented by the creek, you could create a barrier file. Keep in 
 mind that fire barriers will block surface fire spread. However, torching 
 trees could cause the fire to spot over the barrier (in reality as well 
 as within the fire behavior model).</p>
        <p>Selecting the <span class="Code-Command">Fill Barriers</span> checkbox 
 will fill a polygon barrier with unburnable cells so spots cannot start 
 new fires inside the polygon. This option has no effect on a line barrier.</p>
        <p>Barriers can be created as a line or polygon shapefile outside of FlamMap, 
 or within FlamMap using the following steps.</p>
        <p>Use the <img src="../flammaprobo_supporing/Button_DripTorch.png" alt="" border="0" class="img_1" /> toolbar button to locate the position of 
 the barrier on the display pane before you open the "Runs" dialog 
 box. Line and polygon ignitions can be set on the landscape depending 
 on the pattern of mouse button clicks:</p>
        <ul class="ul_2">
            <li class="p">
                <p>Area Barrier - A series of left mouse clicks ending 
	 the polygon with a right mouse click. This will create a closed polygon 
	 defining an active outward burning fire perimeter. You should not 
	 try to close the polygon; this is done automatically after the right 
	 button click.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="p">
                <p>Line Barrier - A series of left mouse clicks ending 
	 with a left double click. The number of left mouse clicks determines 
	 the number of segments of the line ignition.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Select the <span class="Code-Command">Options &gt; Shape &gt; Save to 
 File</span> command to save the currently drawn barrier as a shapefile 
 for future uses and repeated runs.</p>
