                    <p>The 
		 Treatment Optimization Model (TOM) calculations rely on the Minimum 
		 Travel Time (MTT) calculations to identify major fire travel routes 
		 and attempt to block them efficiently with fuel treatments. For 
		 the target weather conditions, this translates to a specific optimization 
		 objective to find the specific treatment areas that reduce fire 
		 growth rates the greatest for the given treatment amount. In other 
		 words, it is attempting to maximize the minimum travel time for 
		 fire moving across the landscape. There are a number of assumptions 
		 of this analysis that are discussed in the <a href="../Tech_Topics/Tech_TOM.htm">Technical 
		 Topics</a>.</p>

        <h2><a name="TOMInputs" id="TOMInputs"></a>Inputs</h2>
        <p>Before getting started, you will need to identify the appropriate landscape 
 size and extent that constitutes a “fireshed” or the spatial domain where 
 large fires can spread under your “target” weather conditions. Your fireshed 
 can be the entire landscape or a portion you define as a separate <a href="../AnalysisCMDs/AA_Analysis_Areas.htm#NewAnalysisArea">Analysis 
 Area</a>. Information for this decision comes from local fire records 
 and “fire atlases” or neighboring areas that depict the location and extent 
 of past large fires. You will need weather records (fuel moistures, wind 
 speed and direction) for those types of large fires that you consider 
 to be a “problem” for fire management or for ecological and other management 
 impacts. This gives you the basic information on the fire scenario and 
 fire behavior for treated and untreated fuel types. That is, you can see 
 how your stand-level fuel treatment prescriptions change the fire behavior.</p>
        <p>Remember that several settings on the <span class="Code-Command"><a href="Minimum_Travel_Time_Tab.htm">Minimum Travel Time</a></span> 
 tab will affect TOM modeling runs, <span class="Code-Command"><a href="Minimum_Travel_Time_Tab.htm#Spot_Probability">Spot 
 Probability</a></span>, <span class="Code-Command"><a href="Minimum_Travel_Time_Tab.htm#Spotting_Delay">Spotting 
 Delay</a></span>, and the <span class="Code-Command"><a href="Minimum_Travel_Time_Tab.htm#Search_Depths">Vertical/Lateral 
 Search Depths</a></span>. &#160;</p>
        <h3><a name="TOMIgnitionFile" id="TOMIgnitionFile"></a>Ignition File</h3>
        <p>This is usually a line ignition located at the upwind edge of a landscape 
 that defines the location where a large fire spreads from (relies on wind 
 entered on the <span class="Code-Command"><a href="Inputs_Tab.htm#Winds">Inputs</a></span> 
 tab). For example, if winds are specified as blowing from the south, the 
 ignition would extend across the southern edge of the landscape. Or, if 
 the wind blows from the southwest, it would extend from the northwest 
 to the southeast.</p>
        <p><span class="span_3">WARNING:</span> If the ignition is 
 not perpendicular to the wind direction or not on the "up wind" 
 side of the landscape strange results can be expected. &#160;</p>
        <p>For a line ignition source you can define current ignitions on the display 
 pane or utilize an existing shapefile created outside of FlamMap. To create 
 a line ignition in FlamMap you must use the driptorch toolbar button to 
 locate the position of the fire at the beginning of the simulations before 
 you open the "Runs" dialog box.</p>
        <p>Typically for a TOM line ignition you would use just two points, beginning 
 and ending. Start with a left mouse click in one corner of the Analysis 
 Area and end with a left double click in an adjacent corner. An example 
 for a line ignition along the west edge of an analysis area;</p>
        <ol class="ol_1">
            <li class="p">
                <p>select the driptorch toolbar button,</p>
            </li>
            <li class="p">
                <p>single click in the upper left corner of the Analysis 
	 Area,</p>
            </li>
            <li class="p">
                <p>left double click in the lower left corner to end 
	 the ignition,</p>
            </li>
            <li class="p">
                <p>click the driptorch toolbar button to end the ignition 
	 mode.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>After opening the "Runs" dialog box you must choose to use 
 the current ignitions for TOM by clicking the <span class="Code-Command">Load 
 Current Ignitions</span> button. You will be asked for a filename for 
 saving this ignition as a shapefile for future uses and repeated runs.</p>
        <h3><a name="TOMResolution" id="TOMResolution"></a>Resolution</h3>
        <p>This setting controls the spacing of the grid (nodes) where FlamMap 
 calculates the outputs. This can be different from the landscape resolution, 
 but there is no benefit to making it smaller than the landscape resolution. 
 Coarser (larger) resolutions results in much faster solution times. For 
 example, 60 meter resolutions will run 4 times as fast as a 30 meter since 
 there are only one-fourth the nodes.</p>
        <h3><a name="TOMIdealLandscape" id="TOMIdealLandscape"></a>Ideal Landscape</h3>
        <p>This is a complete second landscape that depicts the treatment characteristics 
 (surface fuels, canopy fuels etc.) everywhere that treatments can be placed. 
 In other words, you must create a new landscape that contains changes 
 to fuels (that reflect treatment prescriptions) in every polygon or pixel 
 where it is possible to do treatments. TOM will pick those areas for treatment 
 where treatments change fire behavior along major pathways. TOM will only 
 choose treatment locations that reduce the rate of spread – thus, TOM 
 will not locate fuel treatments where fire behavior increases with treatment 
 or the ideal and existing landscape contain identical fuel information.</p>
        <p>The ideal landscape is a difficult concept to comprehend at first since 
 most land managers are familiar with identifying treatments by eliminating 
 areas with resource conflicts. The perfect ideal landscape should propose 
 a treatment for every vegetated cell. It is not the areas that will be 
 treated, only the area that can be treated (and the fire behavior effects 
 of those treatments). TOM will decide the optimum areas to treat based 
 on this and the other input settings. The key to designing a ideal landscape 
 for TOM to use is to design treatments that are commensurate with the 
 resource values to be protected from undesirable fire effects.</p>
        <h3><a name="TOMMaxTreatDimension" id="TOMMaxTreatDimension"></a>Maximum Treatment 
 Dimension</h3>
        <p>This is the maximum distance dimension of the treatment units TOM identifies, 
 in meters. Many times you will have to calculate this based on</p>
        <ol class="ol_1">
            <li class="p">
                <p>the maximum area allowed for a treatment unit (square-root 
	 of area if specified in m<span class="Superscript">2</span>) and</p>
            </li>
            <li class="p">
                <p>the maximum distance that a large fire can travel 
	 before it ideally encounters a treatment unit.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3><a name="TOMIterations_Treatment" id="TOMIterations_Treatment"></a>Iterations/Treatment 
 Level (1-5)</h3>
        <p>This is a minor factor that increases the number iterations and solution 
 time, but has shown only minor benefits in terms of improved output.</p>
        <h3><a name="TOMTreatmentFraction" id="TOMTreatmentFraction"></a>Treatment 
 Fraction</h3>
        <p>This is the maximum proportion of the Analysis Area that can be treated. 
 For example, a setting of 0.15 will attempt to find the 15% of the landscape 
 that makes the most difference to fire growth. The treatment areas will 
 be selected from the areas where the ideal landscape shows a reduction 
 in fire growth compared to the current landscape.</p>
        <p>Experience to date give some indication of useful values,</p>
        <ul class="ul_2">
            <li class="p">
                <p>this setting should be between 0.10 and 0.30,</p>
            </li>
            <li class="p">
                <p>there appears to be little additional benefit gained 
	 with values above 0.30,</p>
            </li>
            <li class="p">
                <p>settings below 0.05 show no effective results,</p>
            </li>
            <li class="p">
                <p>values above 0.50 give results similar to random or 
	 other treatment prioritization methods.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>
            <MadCap:keyword term="Treatment Grid Theme" /><a name="TOMOutputs" id="TOMOutputs"></a>Outputs</h2>
        <p>The TOM procedure produces the same <a href="Minimum_Travel_Time_Tab.htm#MTToutputs">outputs 
 generated by MTT</a> and an additional two grids specific to fuel treatments:</p>
        <ul class="ul_2">
            <li class="p">
                <p><a href="../FileTypes/Treatment_Grid.htm#TreatmentOpportunityGrid">Treatment 
	 Opportunities Grid</a> - Displays the results of comparing the fire 
	 spread rates of the current and ideal landscapes. A positive cell 
	 value indicates the ideal landscape has a lower fire spread rate, 
	 zero indicates no difference between the two landscape, and a negative 
	 value points out where the ideal landscape has a higher spread rate. 
	 TOM will identify treatments only in cells with a value of +1.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="p">
                <p><a href="../FileTypes/Treatment_Grid.htm#TreatmentGrid">Treatment 
	 Grid</a> - TOM selected cells with a value of “1” for treatment. &#160;Cells 
	 with zero values were not treated.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Four default grids are included in every FlamMap run, three of <a href="../FileTypes/PU_OUT_Elliptical_Dimen.htm">Elliptical 
 Dimensions</a> and one for <a href="../FileTypes/PU_OUT_Max_Spread_Dir.htm">Maximum 
 Spread Direction</a>. These are intermediate products of the MTT model 
 and made available for research and creating unique output products.</p>
        <h2><a name="AdditionalMethods" id="AdditionalMethods"></a>Additional Methods</h2>
        <p>The fuel treatments identified by TOM are designed to retard fire growth 
 rates for the landscape as a whole. The effect of any one treatment unit 
 is difficult to discern.</p>
        <p>The difference between the post-treatment and pre-treatment fire growth 
 rates can be demonstrated by running MTT on the pre-treatment landscape 
 and comparing fire arrival times with the same point on the arrival time 
 grid produced by TOM. &#160;</p>
        <p>The treatment grid produced by TOM can be <a href="Output_Grids.htm#SaveAs">exported 
 to a GIS</a> and compared to existing stand-polygon coverages to understand 
 the practical implications of the treatment optimization on actual polygons. 
 The treatment grid tends to clump treated cells together, because neighboring 
 cells often have similar fire behavior, but does not follow any stand 
 or vegetation polygon boundaries. </p>
