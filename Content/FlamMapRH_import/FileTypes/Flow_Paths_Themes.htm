        <p>Flow path themes are the minimum travel time pathways between the user defined nodes. The density or spacing of the nodes is determined by the <span class="Code-Command">Resolution of Calculations</span> setting on either the <span class="Code-Command">Minimum Travel Time</span> or <span class="Code-Command">Treatment Optimization Model</span> tabs. There are four different flow path themes generated by FlamMap. The two MTT path themes are generated from the <span class="Code-Command"><a href="../Runs/Minimum_Travel_Time_Tab.htm">Minimum Travel Time</a></span> tab and the Treat path themes are calculated with the <span class="Code-Command"><a href="../Runs/Treatment_Optimization_Model_Tab.htm">Treatment Optimization Model</a></span>. &#160;All four themes can be <a href="../flammaprobo_supporing/AUX_VectorContour.htm#ManipulatingVectorsContours">exported as an ESRI shapefile</a> for display in Arc GIS products.</p>

        <h2><a name="TreatFlowPaths" id="TreatFlowPaths"></a>Treat Flow Paths</h2>
        <p>This theme displays the post treatment minimum time pathways between all the nodes on the analysis area. The areas treated are shown by the <a href="Treatment_Grid.htm#TreatmentGrid">Treatment grid</a>.</p>
