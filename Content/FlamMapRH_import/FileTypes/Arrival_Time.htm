        <p>An ASCII representation of the number of minutes it takes the fire to reach that location on the landscape from the ignition source. Output values are minutes only. Output resolution determined by the <span class="Code-Command">Resolution of Calculations</span> setting on the <span class="Code-Command">Minimum Travel Time</span> tab.</p>
        <h2><a name="ArrivalTimeContour" id="ArrivalTimeContour"></a>Arrival Time Contour</h2>
        <p>Output called MTT Arrival Time Contour is a vector representation of the MTT Arrival Time grid. As a contour map it is the same as a fire growth perimeter map and reflects the number of minutes it has taken the fire to reach that point on the landscape. The vector version has no units associated with the theme and cannot be queried within FlamMap. Can be exported as an ArcView shapefile.</p>
