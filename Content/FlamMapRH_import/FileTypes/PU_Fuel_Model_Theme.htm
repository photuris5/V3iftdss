        <h1>
            <MadCap:keyword term="Fuel Model Theme" />Fuel Model Theme</h1>
        <p>The raster fuel model theme must specify an integer index to a fuel 
 model. Model numbers 1-13 are reserved for the original standard NFFL 
 fuel models (Anderson, 1983) and some numbers between 101-219 are used 
 for the expanded set of standard models (Scott and Burgan, 2005). Water 
 is represented by number 98 and rock as 99. Other non-burnable values 
 include 90-97. See Table 1, Scott and Burgan, (2005) for a complete list 
 of standard fuel model number assignments.</p>
        <p>Within the United States, pre-made Fuel Model Themes can be found at 
 <a href="http://www.landfire.gov">www.landfire.gov</a>.</p>
        <p>The presence of custom fuel models and/or fuel model conversions in 
 the fuel model theme should be indicated when generating a Landscape (.LCP) 
 File. This is done in the <a href="../AnalysisCMDs/LU_Generate_Landscape.htm">"Landscape 
 (.LCP) File Generation"</a> dialog box, in the <span class="Code-Command">Source 
 Units</span> text box for the <span class="Code-Command">Fuel Model:</span> 
 theme there are four options available from the drop down list;</p>
        <ul class="ul_1">
            <li class="kadov-p"><span class="Code-Command">Class</span>
            </li>
            <li class="kadov-p"><span class="Code-Command">Custom</span>
            </li>
            <li class="kadov-p"><span class="Code-Command">Convert</span>
            </li>
            <li class="kadov-p"><span class="Code-Command">Custom +</span><span class="Code-Command">Convert</span>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Class</h2>
        <p>Indicates the fuel model theme contains only fuel model numbers relating 
 directly to the standard fuel models (original 13, Scott and Burgan set, 
 or 0, 98 or 99 for non-fuel).</p>
        <h2>Custom</h2>
        <p>Indicates custom fuel models are used (see <a href="PU_Custom_Fuel_Model_File.htm">Custom 
 Fuel Model (.FMD) File</a>) in the fuel model theme. The Custom Fuel Model 
 (.FMD) File is identified on the <a href="../Runs/Inputs_Tab.htm"><span class="Code-Command">Inputs</span> tab of the "Run:" dialog 
 box</a>.</p>
        <p>Any fuel model other than the standard fuel models are custom fuel models. 
 These must be assigned model numbers between 1 and 256 NOT already assigned 
 to a standard fuel model. Although <span class="span_2">FARSITE</span> 
 and FlamMap will permit any custom fuel model number between 1 and 256 
 not assigned to a standard fuel model it is best to limit custom model 
 numbers to the range 14-89 to limit conflicts with future standard models.</p>
        <h2>Convert</h2>
        <p>NOTE: FlamMap DOES NOT support fuel model conversions. It is included 
 in the FlamMap "Landscape (LCP) File Generation" dialog box 
 only to make the .LCP files compatible with <span class="span_2">FARSITE</span>.</p>
        <p>Indicates conversion between fuel indices and fuel model numbers is 
 necessary (see <a href="PU_Fuel_Conversion_File.htm">Fuel Conversion (.CNV) 
 File</a>). A fuel index is the integer number describing fuel types in 
 the raster Fuel Model theme. This index must be converted to a fuel model 
 number if:</p>
        <ol>
            <li class="p">
                <p>it exceeds 256,</p>
            </li>
            <li class="p">
                <p>it is one of the standard numbers which does not relate 
	 to one of the standard Fire Behavior fuel models.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>For example, a Fuel Model theme with all indices less than 14 would 
 require selecting only <span class="Code-Command">Convert</span> if all 
 of these did not correspond directly to the 13 NFFL fuel model numbers 
 or 0, 98 or 99 for non-fuel. Select <span class="Code-Command">Custom 
 + Convert</span> if any indices greater than 50 correspond to custom models. 
 If all indices were between 14 and 50 and corresponded to directly to 
 the custom model number, select only <span class="Code-Command">Custom</span> 
 from the drop down list.</p>
        <h2>Custom + Convert:</h2>
        <p>Selecting <span class="Code-Command">Custom + Convert</span> from the 
 drop down menu indicates that custom fuel model indices and are in the 
 fuel model theme and fuel model conversions will be required. The Custom 
 Fuel Model (.FMD) File and Fuel Conversion (.CNV) Files are identified 
 on the <a href="../Runs/Inputs_Tab.htm"><span class="Code-Command">Inputs</span> 
 tab of the "Run:" dialog box</a>.</p>
