        <h1>
            <MadCap:keyword term="Shapefiles:File Information;Projection" />Shapefiles</h1>
        <p>Shapefile is a vector file format used in the GIS <span class="span_2">ArcView</span>. 
 Shapefiles can contain either points, lines, or polygons. Shapefiles actually 
 consist of at least three separate files;</p>
        <ul class="ul_1">
            <li class="p">
                <p>a spatial information file (.SHP),</p>
            </li>
            <li class="p">
                <p>an index file (.SHX),</p>
            </li>
            <li class="p">
                <p>a dBASE file with attribute information (.DBF).</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Typically when opening and saving shapefiles only the .SHP file is listed, 
 but FlamMap manages the required .SHX and .DBF files behind the scenes. 
 There are also many other optional shapefile extensions such as .FBN, 
 .FBX, .SBX, .PRJ, etc that you may see associated with shapefiles created 
 outside of FlamMap. It is important to remember all the file extensions 
 when moving shapefiles or when you get into the mood to clean up your 
 hard drive.</p>
