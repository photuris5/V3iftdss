        <h1>Fuel Conversion File (.CNV)</h1>
        <p>An optional ASCII text file used in the <span class="span_2">FARSITE</span> 
 fire area simulator.</p>
        <p>A Fuel Conversion (.CNV) File is necessary if the fuel model numbers 
 in the GIS Fuel Model theme do not correspond directly to the fuel numbers 
 in the fuel model file or the standard 13 fuel models and 0, 98 or 99 
 for non-fuel. It is recommended that you reclassify your Fuel Model theme 
 to make the fuel attributes correspond directly to fuel models (e.g. use 
 the <span class="span_2">GRASS</span> command r.reclass).</p>
        <p>If you don't want to reclassify the fuel attributes, you'll have to 
 use a Fuel Conversion (.CNV) File. For example, fuel types 68, 74, and 
 86 on the Fuel Model theme may actually correspond to NFFL fuel models 
 (Anderson 1983) 2, 5, and 8, respectively. The Fuel Conversion (.CNV) 
 File would contain the following lines:</p>
        <p class="p_13">68 2<br />
74 5<br />
86 8</p>
        <p>Perhaps a better use for a Fuel Conversion (.CNV) File is for changing 
 the fuel model that a particular fuel attribute represents. For example, 
 your fuel map may contain NFFL fuel models 5 and 8 that you decide should 
 really be 6 and 9, respectively (or custom models). You would then create 
 and load a Fuel Conversion (.CNV) File that contains:</p>
        <p class="p_13">5 6<br />
8 9</p>
        <p>Each Fuel Conversion (.CNV) File must contain data in the space delimited 
 ASCII format specified below. <span class="span_2">FlamMap</span> 
 has a <a href="#Fuel Model Conversions Custom Editor">Custom Editor</a> 
 to help you create or edit Fuel Conversion (.CNV) Files. Or, a text editor 
 such as <span class="span_2">Notepad or WordPad</span>, a 
 spreadsheet, or the <a href="../Runs/Inputs_Tab.htm#FMFiles"><span class="span_2">FlamMap</span> 
 Editor</a> can be used to create or edit ASCII text files.</p>
        <p>The format for the Fuel Conversion (.CNV) File is:</p>
        <p class="p_5"><span class="span_3"><span class="span_2">ConvertFrom 
 FuelMod</span></span>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li class="p">
                <p><span class="span_9">ConvertFrom</span> 
	 is the index or attribute of a fuel type in the Fuel Model theme converted 
	 to a fuel model number 1-99, (<span><span class="span_13">integer</span></span>)</p>
            </li>
            <li class="p">
                <p><span class="span_9">FuelMod</span> 
	 can be any fuel model 1-50, (<span><span class="span_13">integer</span></span>)</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2><a name="Fuel Model Conversions Custom Editor"></a>Using the Fuel Model 
 Conversions File Custom Editor</h2>
        <p>Note: The Fuel Model Conversions (.CNV) File Custom Editor is not currently 
 available in FlamMap. The instructions below are for the <span class="span_2">FARSITE</span> 
 Custom Editor.</p>
        <p>The Fuel Model Conversions (.CNV) File Custom Editor is accessed through 
 the "FARSITE Project" dialog box. The <img src="../flammaprobo_supporing/EditButtonSM.gif" alt="Edit Button" title="Edit Button" width="18" height="20" border="0" class="img_2" /> 
 button to the right of the Fuel Model Conversions (.CNV) File text box 
 brings up the custom editor for generating or editing a Fuel Model Conversions 
 (.CNV) File.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../flammaprobo_supporing/FuelConvertCustomEditor.gif" alt="Fuel Model Conversions Custom Editor" title="Fuel Model Conversions Custom Editor" width="308" height="314" border="0" class="img_1" />
        </p>
        <h3>Editing an Existing Fuel Model Conversions File</h3>
        <p>If you currently have a Fuel Model Conversions (.CNV) File loaded, this 
 dialog box will allow you to edit the contents of that file.</p>
        <p>The Custom Editor allows direct editing in the text box by selecting 
 text with the cursor, using the backspace key, and typing text similar 
 to a text editor.</p>
        <p>You can also use the editing tools in the Custom Editor. First select 
 the range of lines (fuel models) you wish to edit with the cursor. You 
 can use the <span class="Code-Command">Add</span> and <span class="Code-Command">Set</span> 
 buttons to convert the fuel models selected in the text box.</p>
        <ul class="ul_1">
            <li class="p">
                <p>The <span class="Code-Command">Add</span> button adds 
	 the value displayed in the spin box to all the values in the currently 
	 selected lines.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="p">
                <p>The <span class="Code-Command">Set</span> button replaces 
	 the values in the currently selected lines with the value displayed 
	 in the spin box.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Create a New Fuel Model Conversions File</h3>
        <p>To generate a new Fuel Model Conversions (.CNV) File click the <span class="Code-Command">New .CNV File</span> button. A new file with 
 fuel models 1-50 is displayed in the text box. You can edit this data 
 as shown above.</p>
        <h3>Finally</h3>
        <p class="p_2">Before clicking the <span class="Code-Command">Apply 
 &amp; Exit</span> button make sure the modified file has been saved with 
 the <span class="Code-Command">Save .CNV File</span> button. If you don't 
 save the changes, they will still be in effect for the current simulation, 
 but they will be lost when the simulation is terminated. However if the 
 Project (.FPJ) File is saved with an unsaved edited Fuel Model Conversions 
 (.CNV) File, the Fuel Model Conversions (.CNV) File will then be automatically 
 saved also.</p>
