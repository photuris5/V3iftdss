        <p>Vectors are a unique type of FlamMap output. A Spread Vector is a combination 
 of the Maximum Spread Direction and Rate of Spread grids displayed as 
 an arrow.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Spread Vectors are created using a basic FlamMap run and selecting the 
 <span class="Code-Command">Spread Vectors</span> check box on the <span class="Code-Command"><a href="../Runs/Fire_Behavior_Outputs_Tab.htm#OutputGrids">Fire 
 Behavior Outputs</a></span> tab. Their display is controlled with the 
 "<a href="../DisplayCMDs/VectorDisplay.htm">Spread Vector Legend</a>" 
 dialog box. They can be <a href="../flammaprobo_supporing/AUX_VectorContour.htm#SavingContours">exported 
 from FlamMap</a> as point shapefiles (with the Maximum Spread Direction 
 and Rate of Spread as attributes) for use in other applications. The &#160;attribute 
 units for the export are degrees azimuth and meters/min respectively.&#160;</p>
