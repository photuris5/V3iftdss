        <h2>Output from a FlamMap Run</h2>
        <p>The Fire Size List file is an optional output text file created from 
 a burn probability run. It contains the ignition point(XStart, YStart) 
 and FireSize(acres), for each fire used in the burn probability run. FIRE_NUM 
 is the unique ignition ID and can be used to link the MTT_Perimeters output. 
 This text file can be used within a GIS to generate a point shapefile 
 of ignition locations.</p>

        <h2>As Input for a Burn Probability run</h2>
        <p>The Fire Size List file can also be used as an input when <a href="../Runs/Minimum_Travel_Time_Tab.htm#From_Fire_List_File">calculating 
 burn probabilities from a fire list</a>. The Fire List File can be a file 
 from a previously saved burn probability analysis in FlamMap, FSim, or 
 from a text file created by the user. If a text file is created outside 
 of FlamMap by the user it needs to be a comma or space delimited text 
 file with a minimum of three fields in the following order,</p>
        <ol class="ol_1">
            <li class="NumberedFM">FIRE_NUM (integer value used as Fire ID, does 
	 not need to be unique or in order),</li>
            <li class="NumberedFM">XStart (latitude in floating point format using 
	 the landscape units),</li>
            <li class="NumberedFM">YStart (longitude in floating point format using 
	 the landscape units).</li>
        </ol>
        <p>XStart/YStart values also need to be in the same datum and coordinate 
 system as the landscape.</p>
