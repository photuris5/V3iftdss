        <h1>
            <MadCap:keyword term="Projection" />Projections</h1>
        <p>Projections are the information used to orient points or features from 
 a grid or vector file on the surface of the earth. Since the earth is 
 round and maps (computer screens, too) are flat various ways have been 
 devised to "project" the earth's curved surface to a flat display. 
 </p>
        <p>Projection information for FlamMap is saved/transferred in two basic 
 ways, embedded within the points file and as a separate file. </p>
        <h3>Embedded</h3>
        <p><a href="http://www.remotesensing.org/geotiff/faq.html"><MadCap:keyword term="GeoTIFF" />GeoTIFF (.TIF)</a> 
 and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyhole_Markup_Language">Keyhole 
 Markup Language (.KMZ &amp; .KML)</a> files are examples of where the 
 projection information is stored with the feature information in one file. 
 </p>
        <h3>Separate </h3>
        <p><a href="PU_Shapefiles.htm">Shapefiles (.SHP)</a>, <a href="PU_Landscape_File.htm">Landscape 
 (.LCP)</a>, and <a href="PU_Grid_Files.htm">Grid (.ASC)</a> files are 
 are examples of where the projection information is stored in a separate 
 <a href="http://vsp.pnnl.gov/help/Vsample/ESRI_PRJ_File.htm">Projection 
 (.PRJ) File</a>. Typically the Projection (.PRJ) File has the same name 
 and location as the feature file and is differentiated by the .PRJ extension. 
 </p>
        <h2><a name="Projection_Use_in_FlamMap"></a>Projection Use in FlamMap</h2>
        <p>Projection information is not required to use FlamMap, a <a href="PU_Landscape_File.htm">Landscape 
 (.LCP) File</a> without a <a href="http://vsp.pnnl.gov/help/Vsample/ESRI_PRJ_File.htm">Projection 
 (.PRJ) File</a> can be loaded. However there is always a projection for 
 a Landscape (.LCP) File - FlamMap just doesn't have to know what it is. 
 &#160;&#160;So outputs can be created, viewed, and saved - they will have 
 the same projection as the loaded Landscape (.LCP) File. Auxiliary themes 
 without a Projection (.PRJ) File can also be loaded and displayed as long 
 as the user makes sure they were created in the same projection as the 
 loaded Landscape (.LCP) File. </p>
        <p><span class="span_3">WARNING:</span> All geospatial inputs 
 used in FlamMap are still required to be in the same map datum and coordinate 
 system as FlamMap will not reproject features "on the fly" as 
 most GIS applications do.</p>
        <p>FlamMap will not create <a href="http://www.remotesensing.org/geotiff/faq.html">GeoTIFF 
 (.TIF)</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyhole_Markup_Language">KMZ</a> 
 format outputs or attach a <a href="http://vsp.pnnl.gov/help/Vsample/ESRI_PRJ_File.htm">Projection 
 (.PRJ) File</a> to saved outputs without valid projection information. 
 </p>
        <h3><a name="Valid_Projection"></a>A Valid Projection</h3>
        <p>The projection for a FlamMap Project is set by the projection of the 
 landscape. Valid projection information can be linked to a FlamMap Project 
 in two ways;</p>
        <ul class="ul_1">
            <li class="BulletFM">By loading a <a href="PU_Landscape_File.htm">Landscape 
	 (.LCP) File</a> with a <a href="http://vsp.pnnl.gov/help/Vsample/ESRI_PRJ_File.htm">Projection 
	 (.PRJ) File</a> in the same folder, with the same name.</li>
            <li class="BulletFM">By loading a <a href="http://www.remotesensing.org/geotiff/faq.html">GeoTIFF 
	 (.TIF)</a> format landscape, which has the projection information 
	 embedded in the .TIF file.</li>
        </ul>
