        <p>An optional output grid from the minimum travel time fire growth model.</p>
        <p>This feature produces a single output map that contains the fraction 
 of the number of fires that encountered each node (0.0 to 1.0). These 
 are conditional probabilities, the assumption is that a fire has started, 
 or given a fire start this is the probability that a given node will burn. 
 This output gives on indication of the probability of a fire starting.</p>
        <p>High burn probabilities are related to the sizes of fires that occur 
 on a given landscape -- for the same conditions, large fires produce higher 
 probabilities than small fires (each burn a larger fraction of the landscape). 
 Since fire size is a function of the gross spread rate and duration of 
 the fire, treatments or conditions that reduce the spread rate will lower 
 the burn probability. &#160;</p>
        <p>The burn probabilities calculated by FlamMap use static fuel moistures 
 and winds for the entire burn period. Unlike FSPro or FSim which assign 
 different fuel moistures and winds for each burn day. </p>
