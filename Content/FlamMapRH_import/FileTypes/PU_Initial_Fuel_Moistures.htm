            <MadCap:keyword term="Initial Fuel Moisture File:File Information;Initial Fuel Moisture File;Dead Fuel Moisture Content" />Initial Fuel Moistures File (.FMS)</h1>
        <p>The Initial Fuel Moistures (.FMS) File is a ASCII text file required 
 for any <span class="span_2">FlamMap</span> run. This is 
 the same format used in the <span class="span_2">FARSITE</span> 
 fire area simulator, so Initial Fuel Moistures (.FMS) Files are interchangeable 
 between the two applications.</p>
        <p>The fuel moistures from the Initial Fuel Moistures (.FMS) File can be 
 used one of two ways in FlamMap.</p>
        <ol class="ol_1">
            <li class="p">
                <p>The fuel moistures from the file are used "as 
	 is" to calculate the fire behavior characteristics for a FlamMap 
	 run.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="p">
                <p>Or the fuel moistures are used as a starting point 
	 for the <a href="../Tech_Topics/Tech_Dead_Fuel_Moisture.htm">optional 
	 dead fuel moisture model</a> which also requires <a href="PU_Weather_File.htm">Weather 
	 (.WTR)</a> and <a href="PU_Wind_File.htm">Wind (.WND)</a> Files or 
	 a <a href="Weather_Stream_File.htm">Weather Stream (.WXS)</a> File. 
	 The starting dead fuel moistures are modified during a conditioning 
	 period based on the weather streams, topography, and shading before 
	 calculating the fire behavior characteristics in the FlamMap run. 
	 Live fuel moistures are not modified by the dead fuel moisture model. 
	 </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Each Initial Fuel Moistures (.FMS) File must contain at least one line 
 in the space delimited ASCII format specified below. FlamMap has tools 
 (see below) to help you create or edit Initial Fuel Moistures (.FMS) Files. 
 Or, a text editor such as <span class="span_2">Notepad or 
 WordPad</span>, or a spreadsheet can be used to create or edit ASCII text 
 files.</p>
        <p>The following ASCII integer space-delimited format is used;</p>
        <p class="p_10"><span class="span_3"><span class="span_2">FuelMod 1Hour 10Hour 100Hour LiveH LiveW</span></span>

        <ul class="ul_1">
            <li>
                <p>Fuel Model "0" is the default for fuel models not 
	 listed in the Initial Fuel Moistures (.FMS) File. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Fuel Models 1-256 corresponds to a standard fuel model (Anderson, 
	 1983 or Scott and Burgan, 2005) or one described in a <a href="PU_Custom_Fuel_Model_File.htm">Custom 
	 Fuel Model (.FMD) File</a>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Fuel moistures for each category are in percent (integers), 
	 and may exceed 100. <span class="span_9">LiveH</span> 
	 and <span class="span_9">LiveW</span> 
	 indicate "live woody" and "live herbaceous" fuels, 
	 just like <span class="span_2">BehavePlus</span>. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If custom fuel models are used, they can have initial fuel moistures 
	 specified in this file or rely on the default (fuel model "0") 
	 values.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><span class="span_3">NOTE:</span> An Initial Fuel Moistures 
 (.FMS) File with one line (using fuel model "0") will suffice 
 for a run, but creating a line for each fuel model is prefered as this 
 allows calibration of individual fuel models using the dead and live fuel 
 moistures. A Initial Fuel Moistures (.FMS) File with all the fuel models 
 for a landscape can be easily created with the <a href="#New_Initial_Fuel_Moistures_File">Create 
 New Initial Fuel Moistures File feature</a> described below.</p>
        <h2><a name="Edit_an_Initial_Fuel_Moistures_File"></a>Edit Existing Initial 
 Fuel Moistures File</h2>
        <p>If an Initial Fuel Moistures (.FMS) File is currently loaded on the 
 <span class="Code-Command">Inputs</span> Tab, clicking the <img src="../flammaprobo_supporing/Button_Editor.gif" alt="" border="0" class="img_1" /> button allows you to inspect 
 the Initial Fuel Moisture (.FMS) File and modify the fuel moistures or 
 fuel models using the <a href="../flammaprobo_supporing/FlamMap_Text_Editor.htm">FlamMap Text 
 Editor</a>. </p>
        <h2><a name="New_Initial_Fuel_Moistures_File"></a>Create New Initial Fuel Moistures 
 File</h2>
        <p>You can create a new&#160;Initial Fuel Moisture (.FMS) File by clicking 
 the <img alt="" src="../flammaprobo_supporing/Button_DefaultMoistures.png" border="0" class="img_1" /> button which open the "Set Default Fuel 
 Moistures" dialog box where you set the initial fuel moistures for 
 all fuel models found in the <a href="PU_Landscape_File.htm">Landscape 
 (.LCP) File</a>.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../flammaprobo_supporing/SetDefaultFuelMoistures.png" alt="" border="0" class="img_1" />
        </p>
        <p>Clicking the <span class="Code-Command">OK</span> button in the "Set 
 Default Fuel Moistures" dialog box then opens the Initial Fuel Moisture 
 (.FMS) File in the FlamMap text editor.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../flammaprobo_supporing/NewFMSFile.png" alt="" border="0" class="img_1" />
        </p>
        <p>There you can inspect the fuel moisture and modify the fuel moistures 
 for individual fuel models using the <a href="../flammaprobo_supporing/FlamMap_Text_Editor.htm">FlamMap 
 Text Editor</a>. Note that the default Fuel Model "0" is included 
 so the Initial Fuel Moistures (.FMS) File can be used with other landscapes. 
 </p>
        <h3>Finally</h3>
        <p>Before exiting the FlamMap Text Editor make sure the modified file has 
 been saved with either the <span class="Code-Command">Save</span> <img src="../flammaprobo_supporing/Button_Save.gif" alt="" border="0" class="img_1" /> 
 or <span class="Code-Command">Save As</span> <img src="../flammaprobo_supporing/SaveAsButton.png" alt="" border="0" class="img_1" /> button. 
 If you don't save the changes, they will still be in effect for the current 
 simulation, but they will be lost when the simulation is terminated. However 
 if the Project (.FPJ) File is saved with an unsaved edited Initial Fuel 
 Moistures (.FMS) File, the Initial Fuel Moistures (.FMS) File will then 
 be automatically saved also.</p>
