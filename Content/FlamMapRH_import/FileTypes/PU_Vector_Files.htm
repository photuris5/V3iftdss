        <h1>
            <MadCap:keyword term="Shapefiles:File Information;Vector Files" />Vector Files</h1>
        <p>Vector refers to a type of spatial data used by a GIS that consists 
 of dimension less points, lines, or polygons. Their significance depends 
 upon the context in which they are used or displayed. Vector themes can 
 be attached to a FlamMap project as Auxiliary Themes to depict roads or 
 streams that overlay the visible grid theme providing reference and familiarity 
 with the landscape. Projects saved with Auxiliary vector themes will redraw 
 the vectors automatically as saved when the project is re-opened.</p>
        <p><span class="span_2">FlamMap</span> can utilize only vector 
 files in the ARCVIEW shapefile format (.SHP). Shapefiles actually consist 
 of at least three separate files;</p>
        <ul class="ul_1">
            <li class="BulletFM">a spatial information file (.SHP),</li>
            <li class="BulletFM">an index file (.SHX),</li>
            <li class="BulletFM">a dBASE file with attribute information (.DBF).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Typically when opening and saving shapefiles only the .SHP file is listed, 
 but FlamMap manages the required .SHX and .DBF files behind the scenes. 
 There are also many other optional shapefile extensions such as .FBN, 
 .FBX, SBX, etc that you may see associated with shapefiles created outside 
 of FlamMap. It is important to remember all the file extensions when moving 
 shapefiles or when you get into the mood to clean up your hard drive.</p>
        <p>Remember that ArcView shapefiles are really three or more separate files. 
 Besides the .SHP file, the files with .SHX and .DBF extensions are required 
 to use shapefiles in FlamMap.</p>
