        <p>A FlamMap Project (.FMP) File contains most of the inputs and customizations 
 that you've made for a analysis. A project file is used to speed up the 
 process of loading files and setting the customizations for subsequent 
 analyses.</p>
        <p>A Project (.FMP) File contains pointers to all of the <a href="ug3_Data_Requirements.htm#GIS_Data_Units">data 
 themes and files</a> for FlamMap<span class="span_2">,</span> 
 as well as run settings and display customizations set at the time the 
 project file was made.</p>
        <p>You can also create an <a href="PU_Archive_File.htm">Archive (.FZA) 
 File</a> that saves everything from your FlamMap Project to one compressed 
 file for easy transporting or archiving.</p>
