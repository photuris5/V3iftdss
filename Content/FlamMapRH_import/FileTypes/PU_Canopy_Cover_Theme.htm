        <p>The canopy cover theme is necessary for computing wind reduction factors 
 and shading in the optional dead fuel moisture model. Canopy cover is 
 the horizontal percentage of the ground surface that is covered by tree 
 crowns. It is a stand-level descriptor.</p>
        <p>Canopy Cover is NOT the same as crown closure. Canopy cover is measured 
 as the horizontal fraction of the ground that is covered directly overhead 
 by tree canopy. Crown closure refers to the ecological condition of relative 
 tree crown density. Stands can be said to be "closed" to recruitment 
 of canopy trees but still only have 40% or 50% canopy cover.</p>
        <p>Coverage units can be categories (1-4) or percentage values (0-100). 
 Categories are assumed to be the following:</p>
        <ol class="ol_1">
            <li class="NumberedFM">1-20%</li>
            <li class="NumberedFM">21-50%</li>
            <li class="NumberedFM">50-80%</li>
            <li class="NumberedFM">81-100%</li>
        </ol>
        <p>with zero cover specified by 0 or 99.</p>
        <p>Canopy Cover can also be described as a constant across the entire landscape 
 when <a href="../AnalysisCMDs/LU_Generate_Landscape.htm">generating a 
 Landscape (.LCP) File</a> with the "Landscape (LCP) File Generation" 
 dialog box.</p>
        <p>Within the United States, pre-made Canopy Base Height Themes can be 
 found at <a href="http://www.landfire.gov">www.landfire.gov</a></p>
