        <p>Canopy Base Height (CBH) is an optional raster theme that is important 
 for determining transition from surface fire to crown fire. For a single 
 tree it is the height to the bottom of the live crown, it gets tricky 
 when attempting to expand this concept to a stand or area basis. CBH should 
 incorporate the effects of ladder fuels (if present) in increasing vertical 
 continuity and assisting transition to crown fire. Typically a mature, 
 dense, multi-storied Spruce/Subalpine Fir stand would have a CBH of 1 
 to 3 feet while an open park of old growth Ponderosa Pine would have a 
 CBH of 30 feet or more. Conditions in between these two extremes are more 
 difficult to estimate.</p>
        <p>Values can be in meters or feet. The precision of the fire behavior 
 calculations are limited to the nearest 1/10th meter or foot. Thus, if 
 you have integer values and you want greater precision you should use 
 the calculator features of your GIS to multiply the original crown base 
 units by 10 and select <span class="Code-Command">meters*10</span> or 
 <span class="Code-Command">feet*10</span> in the "Generate Landscape 
 (.LCP) File" dialog box. This conversion is optional for decimal 
 crown base height values.</p>
        <p>Within the United States, pre-made Canopy Base Height Themes can be
