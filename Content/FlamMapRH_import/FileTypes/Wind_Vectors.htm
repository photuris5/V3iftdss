        <h1>
            <MadCap:keyword term="Wind Inputs;Wind Grids:File Information;Wind Vectors" />Wind Vectors</h1>
        <p>Wind Vectors are a unique type of FlamMap vector file. A Wind Vector 
 is a combination of the Wind Direction and Speed grids displayed as an 
 arrow.</p>

        </p>
        <p>The display of Wind Vectors can be modified in the <a href="../DisplayCMDs/VectorDisplay.htm">"Wind 
 Vectors Legend"</a> dialog box. </p>
        <h2>Creating Wind Vectors</h2>
        <p>Wind Vectors can be created in FlamMap in several ways, </p>
        <ul class="ul_1">
            <li class="BulletFM">They can also be created outside of FlamMap (i.e. 
	 Fluent Wind Wizard) as shapefiles and viewed in FlamMap as <a href="../AnalysisCMDs/AUX_Auxiliary_Themes.htm">Auxiliary 
	 Themes</a>, </li>
            <li class="BulletFM">Wind Vectors are automatically generated from 
	 Wind Grids used for a run,</li>
            <li class="BulletFM">And they are automatically generated when the 
	 <a href="#WindNinja_Options"><MadCap:keyword term="Wind Ninja" />Wind Ninja Option</a> is used.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><span class="span_3">NOTE:</span> Wind Vector shapefiles 
 cannot be used for fire behavior calculations in FlamMap, only Wind Grids 
 or the WindNinja Option can be used to calculate fire behavior outputs.</p>
        <h2><a name="WindNinja_Options"></a>Wind Ninja Options</h2>
        <p>The <span class="Code-Command">Wind Ninja Options</span> button is activated 
 when the <span class="Code-Command">Generate Wind Vectors</span> radio 
 button is selected on the <span class="Code-Command">Inputs</span> tab 
 of the "Run:" dialog box. More information on WindNinja can 
 be found at the <a href="http://www.firelab.org/project/windninja">Wind 
 Ninja website</a>. </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../flammaprobo_supporing/Section_WindNinja.png" alt="" border="0" class="img_1" />
        </p>
        <p>Clicking the <span class="Code-Command">Wind Ninja Options</span> button 
 opens the "Wind Ninja Options" dialog box. </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../flammaprobo_supporing/WindNinjaOptions.png" alt="" border="0" class="img_1" />
        </p>
        <p>The basic Wind Ninja Option is to simply select a resolution for the 
 Wind Grids/Vectors and click the <span class="Code-Command">OK</span> 
 button. Your resolution should be larger than the landscape resolution 
 or <span class="Code-Command">Resolution of Calculations</span> setting 
 (MTT or TOM tabs). Typically 2x or 3x will give good, fast results.</p>
        <p>For runs without Diurnal Simulation a <span class="Code-Command">Calculation 
 Date/Time</span> is not required. Wind Ninja simply calculates the Wind 
 Grids/Vectors given the landscape terrain and the Wind Speed/Direction 
 entered in the spin boxes on the <span class="Code-Command">Inputs</span> 
 tab.</p>
        <h3>Diurnal Settings</h3>
        <p>A simple model has been included in Wind Ninja to simulate diurnal slope 
 winds. It is designed to compute small scale slope winds, but not larger 
 scale valley winds. The slope winds will have some effect of producing 
 valley winds, but it will be slight. Also, the model will not simulate 
 other buoyancy driven flows such as sea or land breezes.</p>
        <p>For a Wind Ninja Diurnal Simulation select the <span class="Code-Command">Use 
 Diurnal Simulation</span> check box and use one of the following options 
 to fill in the <span class="Code-Command">Air Temp</span>, <span class="Code-Command">Cloud 
 Cover</span>, <span class="Code-Command">Longitude</span>, and <span class="Code-Command">Time 
 Zone</span> spin boxes.</p>
        <ul class="ul_1">
            <li class="BulletFM">When using a <a href="../Runs/Inputs_Tab.htm#FMSettings">fuel 
	 moisture conditioning period</a> click the <span class="Code-Command">Use 
	 Conditioning Period End</span> button to fill in the <span class="Code-Command">Air 
	 Temp </span>and <span class="Code-Command">Cloud Cover</span> spin 
	 boxes from the .WTR, .WND, or .WXS files. The <span class="Code-Command">Longitude</span> 
	 spin box will be interpolated from the landscape if a valid projection 
	 information is present for the <a href="../AnalysisCMDs/FM_Project.htm">FlamMap 
	 Project</a>. The <span class="Code-Command">Time Zone</span> will 
	 need to be set manually by the user using the drop down menu.</li>
            <li class="BulletFM">When using a Fixed Fuel Moisture run manually 
	 enter values for the <span class="Code-Command">Air Temp</span>, <span class="Code-Command">Cloud Cover</span>, <span class="Code-Command">Longitude</span>, 
	 <span class="Code-Command">Time Zone</span>, <span class="Code-Command">Day</span>, 
	 and <span class="Code-Command">Time</span> spin boxes.</li>
            <li class="BulletFM">The values for <span class="Code-Command">Air 
	 Temp</span>, <span class="Code-Command">Cloud Cover</span>, <span class="Code-Command">Longitude</span>, <span class="Code-Command">Time 
	 Zone</span>, <span class="Code-Command">Day</span>, and <span class="Code-Command">Time</span> 
	 can also be entered manually when using a <a href="../Runs/Inputs_Tab.htm#FMSettings">fuel 
	 moisture conditioning period</a>. This option is not recommended as 
	 it requires careful review of the weather inputs. &#160;</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Remember Wind Ninja calculates the Wind Grids/Vectors given the landscape 
 terrain and the Wind Speed/Direction entered in the spin boxes on the 
 <span class="Code-Command">Inputs</span> tab. During the wind computation, 
 these winds will be combined with the diurnal winds to produce the final 
 wind field. Output of simulations done with light domain average winds 
 (say 1-5 mph) will show significant effect of the diurnal winds. Strong 
 domain average wind cases will not show much diurnal effect because they 
 are overpowered.</p>
        <p><span class="span_3">WARNING:</span> When manually entering 
 <span class="Code-Command">Diurnal Settings</span> be careful that the 
 fuel moistures are calculated at the same simulation time as the Diurnal 
 Simulation winds! i.e. using mid-afternoon fuel moistures with nighttime 
 diurnal simulation could result in unrealistic or bizarre results.</p>
        <p>When all the Diurnal Settings are verified, click the <span class="Code-Command">OK</span> 
 button and the Wind Grids and Vectors will be calculated when the <span class="Code-Command">Launch</span> button is clicked.</p>
