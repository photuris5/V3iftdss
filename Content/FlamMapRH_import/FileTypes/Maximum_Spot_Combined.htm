            <MadCap:keyword term="Maximum Spotting:Combined" />Maximum Spot Combined</h1>
        <p>An output grid where the Max Spot Direction and Distance are combined 
 into a single floating point value. Units for the maximum spot distance 
 are in meters and the maximum spot direction is in radians. The intergral 
 part of the floating point value represents the distance and the fractional 
 part the direction in radians. For example, a value of 1351.54980 represents 
 a maximum spot distance of 1351 meters and a maximum spot direction of 
 315.01 degrees.</p>
