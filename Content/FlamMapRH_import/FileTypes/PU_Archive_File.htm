        <p>The Archive (.FZA) File saves everything for your FlamMap Project to one compressed file for ease transporting. This feature is very useful for sending a project to someone else, transferring your work between computers, backing up your work, or archiving a completed project. A FlamMap Archive (.FZA) File is created for an open project with the <span class="Code-Command"><a href="../AnalysisCMDs/FM_Project.htm#SaveArchive">File &gt; Save and Archive</a></span> command.</p>
        <p>The Archive (.FZA) File is compressed in the .zip format and can also be extracted with the WinZip8 utility as well as with the <span class="Code-Command"><a href="../AnalysisCMDs/FM_Project.htm#ExtractArchive">File &gt; Extract and Open Archive</a></span> command in FlamMap.</p>
