            <MadCap:keyword term="Canopy Bulk Density Theme" />Canopy Bulk Density Theme</h1>
        <p>Canopy Bulk Density (CBD) is an optional raster theme that is needed 
 to determine the &#160;characteristics of crown fires. </p>
        <p>Within the United States, pre-made Canopy Bulk Density Themes can be 
 found at <a href="http://www.landfire.gov">www.landfire.gov</a>.</p>
        <p>The values in the raster theme can be integers or decimal values in 
 either kg/m<span class="Superscript">3</span> or lb/ft<span class="Superscript">3</span>. 
 The precision of canopy bulk density values are used to the nearest 100th 
 kg/m<span class="Superscript">3</span> or 1000 lb/ft<span class="Superscript">3</span>. 
 Thus, if you have integer values in your canopy bulk density theme, you 
 must use the calculator features of your GIS to multiply the original 
 canopy bulk density units by 100 (kg/m<span class="Superscript">3</span>) 
 or 1000 (lb/ft<span class="Superscript">3</span>). This conversion is 
 optional for decimal bulk density values.</p>
        <p>Thus, if the actual canopy bulk density were in metric units (say 0.25 
 Kg/m<span class="Superscript">3</span>), the value in the raster map would 
 be multiplied by 100 to give an index of 25 for those cells. If the actual 
 canopy bulk density were in English units (say .015 lb/ft<span class="Superscript">3</span>), 
 the value in the raster map would be multiplied by 1000 to give an index 
 of 15 for those cells.</p>
        <p>A value of zero for CBD is invalid, zero values will be assumed to be 
 0.1 when encountered in a simulation.</p>
        <p>However, if the <a href="PU_Canopy_Cover_Theme.htm">canopy cover theme</a> 
 has a value of zero for a cell then the data in the canopy bulk density 
 theme (as well as canopy base height and stand height themes) is ignored 
 for that cell in a simulation since FlamMap assumes there is no tree cover 
 for that cell.</p>
        <p><span class="span_3">IMPORTANT NOTE</span>: When developing 
 the CBD theme for your Landscape (.LCP) File you need to consider the 
 crown fire calculation method. There are two ways of calculating crown 
 fire available in the <a href="../Runs/Fire_Behavior_Outputs_Tab.htm#CrownFireCalculation">"Fire 
 Behavior Outputs" dialog box</a>. The Scott and Reinhardt (2001) 
 crown fire calculation assumes using the 15 ft. running mean method of 
 determining canopy bulk density found in FVS-FFE and FMA Plus. The Finney 
 (1998) calculation requires significantly higher canopy bulk densities, 
 a crude approximation is to double the CBD calculated with the 15 ft. 
 running mean method.</p>
