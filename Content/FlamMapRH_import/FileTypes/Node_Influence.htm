        <p>Node Influence grids are ASCII representations of the number of nodes or cells upstream exerting influence on the fire pathways. Output is the log (ln) of the frequency of the number of nodes influenced. The higher the frequency the stronger the influence while the lower the number the lower the influence.</p>
        <h2><a name="MTTNodeInfluence" id="MTTNodeInfluence"></a>MTT Node Influence Grid</h2>
        <p>The grid named MTT Node Influence is the result of calculations done on the main (or base) Landscape (.LCP) File with the wind and fuel moistures specified on the Inputs tab. Cell size is determined by the <span class="Code-Command">Resolution of Calculations</span> setting on the <span class="Code-Command">Minimum Travel Time</span> tab.</p>
        <h2><a name="TreatNodeInfluence" id="TreatNodeInfluence"></a>Treat Node Influence Grid</h2>
        <p>The Treat Node Influence grid is the result of the node influence calculations done after the treatments identified by the Treatment Optimization Model. Cell size is determined by the <span class="Code-Command">Resolution of Calculations</span> setting on the <span class="Code-Command">Treatment Optimization Model</span> tab.</p>
