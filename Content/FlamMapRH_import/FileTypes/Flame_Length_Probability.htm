            <MadCap:keyword term="Flame Length Probability" />Flame Length Probability File</h1>
        <p>A comma delimited text file with the flame length probability (FLP) 
 at each node based on the MTT. The FLP file is available in English and 
 metric versions.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>This screenshot is an example of the English version which has the conditional 
 probability by six categories of Fire Intensity Levels. Conditional probability 
 is the probability of the flame length occurring given that at least one 
 of the simulated fires has burned the node. &#160;</p>
        <p><span class="span_3">WARNING:</span> Conditional probability 
 is a complex concept and requires careful interpretation. </p>
        <p>The fields of the English file are, </p>
        <ul class="ul_1">
            <li class="BulletFM">XPos - the X coordinate of the MTT node,</li>
            <li class="BulletFM">YPos - the Y coordinate of the MTT node,</li>
            <li class="BulletFM">PBurn - the overall burn probability for the node, 
	 this is the same as displayed in the <a href="Burn_Probabilities.htm">Burn 
	 Probability grid</a>,</li>
            <li class="BulletFM">FIL1 - the conditional probability of a flame 
	 length &lt; 2 ft,</li>
            <li class="BulletFM">FIL2 - the conditional probability of a flame 
	 length =&gt; 2 ft and &lt; 4 ft,</li>
            <li class="BulletFM">FIL3 - the conditional probability of a flame 
	 length =&gt; 4 ft and &lt; 6 ft,</li>
            <li class="BulletFM">FIL4 - the conditional probability of a flame 
	 length =&gt; 6 ft and &lt; 8 ft,</li>
            <li class="BulletFM">FIL5 - the conditional probability of a flame 
	 length =&gt; 8 ft and &lt; 10 ft,</li>
            <li class="BulletFM">FIL6 - the conditional probability of a flame 
	 length &gt; 10 ft.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The metric version of the file is similar except it has conditional 
 probability for 20 categories of Fire Intensity Levels (FIL) expressed 
 as flame lengths in 0.5 meter categories for FIL1 – FIL19 and FIL20 &gt; 
 9.5 meters.</p>
