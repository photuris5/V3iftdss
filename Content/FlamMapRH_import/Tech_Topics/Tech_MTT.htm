        <h1>Minimum Travel Time Fire Growth Model</h1>
        <h2><a name="BasicMTT" id="BasicMTT"></a>Basic Model</h2>
        <p>The Minimum Travel Time (MTT) feature is a two-dimensional fire growth 
 model. It calculates fire growth and behavior by searching for the set 
 of pathways with minimum fire spread times from point, line or polygon 
 ignition sources (Finney, 2002). In theory, the results are identical 
 to wave-front expansion used in <span class="span_2">FARSITE</span> 
 with the exception that all weather and fuel moisture conditions are held 
 constant over time with MTT but allowed to vary with time in <span class="span_2">FARSITE</span>. 
 &#160;</p>
        <p>At a user specified resolution of data cells, the algorithm finds the 
 minimum travel paths by calculating travel times from each node (cell 
 corners) to every other node on the landscape. Travel pathways are straight 
 lines that connect nodes and intersect cells to form segments for which 
 fire behavior is calculated from the input data.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Efficiencies in computation are afforded by stopping the search for 
 a particular node after a specified number of failures occur in the search 
 (in the X- and Y- directions). The algorithm is parallelized to make use 
 of multiple CPUs on a computer system.</p>
        <h2><a name="BurnProbability" id="BurnProbability"></a>Burn Probabilities</h2>
        <p>In addition to calculating fire growth for a single fire, MTT can be 
 used to compute burn probabilities for a specified number of randomly 
 located ignition points each of a constant duration. Burn probabilities 
 provide one method of evaluating the effectiveness of fuel treatments 
 that removes the uncertainty of ignition sources. A large sample size 
 of ignitions (say 1000’s or 10,000’s) on the treated and pre-treatment 
 landscape gives an indication of the overall effectiveness of the landscape 
 pattern in retarding the growth of large fires. &#160;High burn probabilities 
 are related to the sizes of fires that occur on a given landscape -- for 
 the same conditions, large fires produce higher probabilities than small 
 fires (each burn a larger fraction of the landscape). Since fire size 
 is a function of the gross spread rate and duration of the fire, treatments 
 that reduce the spread rate will lower the burn probability. This feature 
 produces a single output map that contains the fraction of the number 
 of fires that encountered each node (0.0 to 1.0). For further analysis 
 this map can be saved in ASCII grid format to import into a GIS where 
 grid statistics and other procedures can be calculated.</p>
        <p>Note: this process is very CPU intensive because it involves simulating 
 fire growth from perhaps thousands of random ignitions. This is best performed 
 on multi-processor computers or when long time periods for computing are 
 acceptable.</p>
