        <h1>Spotting (technical documentation)</h1>
        <h2>FlamMap Spotting Process</h2>
        <h3>Basic Maximum Spot Themes</h3>
        <p>Fire behavior is calculated for each landscape node, nodes are a fixed 
 grid equal to the landscape or MTT spatial resolution. If a node experiences 
 <a href="Tech_Crown_Fire.htm">passive or active crownfire</a>, sixteen 
 (16) incrementally-sized embers are lofted and followed to determine the 
 maximum spotting distance and direction. Crown Fraction Burned and canopy 
 cover are used to determine “number of torching trees” (1-10) used in 
 firebrand lofting height. Maximum spotting distance &amp; azimuth are 
 calculated using canopy cover, crown fraction burned, elevation, and all 
 available wind information. The Maximum Spot themes are created from this 
 information.</p>
        <h3>MTT and TOM Outputs</h3>
        <p>For Runs utilizing the MTT fire growth model (<a href="Tech_MTT.htm">MTT</a> 
 and <a href="Tech_TOM.htm">TOM</a> Runs) the Maximum Spot themes are created 
 as described above. As each node in MTT burns it checks for Maximum Spot 
 data for that location. If it encounters Maximum Spot data at a node, 
 MTT then draws a random number (0.0 – 1.0). If the random number is greater-than 
 the user entered spotting probability, the location is discarded and no 
 spotting occurs from that node during that time frame. Otherwise, MTT 
 then calculates a flight distance for the ember as follows:</p>
        <p class="p_5">distance = &#160;–log( r ) * Maximum Spot 
 Distance / 5</p>
        <p>where r is a random number (0.0 – 1.0). MTT then calculates the landing 
 node for the ember using the calculated distance and the direction from 
 the Maximum Spot Direction theme. If the node is non-burnable or already 
 burning, the ember is discarded and spotting does not occur from the source 
 node. Otherwise the node is set as an ignition with initial start time 
 of the current simulation time.</p>
        <p>The spotting distance used to determine the landing node for an ember 
 will never be greater than the Maximum Spot Distance value at the source 
 node. </p>
        <h2>Limitations &amp; Assumptions</h2>
        <p class="PdfParaStyle22">Spotting only occurs when passive or active crown 
 fire is modeled. Finney (1998) or Scott &amp; Reinhardt (2001) crown fire 
 methods are options set by the user. Each method calculates Crown Fraction 
 Burned (CFB) differently. </p>
        <p class="PdfParaStyle23"><span class="PdfCharStyle3">More embers will 
 be lofted at finer landscape resolutions. Faster rate of spread (ROS) 
 will encounter more nodes, but the absolute number of nodes is static. 
 Because only one ember per node is used there is less chance that an ember 
 will travel the maximum distance compared to Near Term Fire Behavior (NTFB) 
 in WFDSS and in</span><span class="PdfCharStyle7">FARSITE</span><span class="PdfCharStyle3">.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="PdfParaStyle23"><span class="PdfCharStyle3">A </span><span class="Code-Command">Spot 
 Probability</span><span class="PdfCharStyle3"> of zero will prevent any 
 spot fires from </span>occurring, effectively disabling the spotting feature.</p>
