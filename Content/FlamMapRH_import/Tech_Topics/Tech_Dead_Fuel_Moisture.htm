        <h1>Dead Fuel Moisture (technical documentation)</h1>
        <hr size="3" width="100%" align="center" />
        <p>The change in moisture content of dead and downed woody surface fuels 
 throughout time and topography is often critical to calculating fire behavior 
 characteristics. In general, drier fuels increase fire rate of spread, 
 fireline intensity, and fuel consumption. FlamMap uses a model to calculate 
 dead fuel moisture during a conditioning period in response to changing 
 weather conditions and topography. Moisture contents of live fuels are 
 assumed to remain constant in FlamMap throughout the conditioning period. 
 Dead fuel moisture is an important input to the surface fire behavior 
 model (Rothermel 1972) for determining rate of spread and intensity of 
 surface fires.</p>
        <h2>Fuel Size Classes</h2>
        <p>The rate of change of the moisture content is dependent on the diameter 
 of the woody fuel particle and the amount of change in environment conditions. 
 Historically, the diameters of the woody fuel particles have been classified 
 according to their "time lag". Time lag refers to the length 
 of time that a particle responds to within 63.2% (1-1/e) of the new equilibrium 
 moisture content (either drying or wetting). Larger diameter fuels generally 
 have longer time-lags, meaning they respond more slowly to changes in 
 environmental conditions. The time lag categories traditionally used for 
 fire behavior and fire danger rating are specified as: 1hr, 10hr, 100hr, 
 and 1000hr and correspond to round woody fuels in the size range of: 0-¼", 
 ¼"-1", 1"-3", and 3"-8" (0-.635cm, 0.635-2.54cm, 
 2.54-7.62cm, and 7.62-20.32cm) respectively. Loadings (weight/area) of 
 dead fuels in these size-classes are required to describe surface fuels 
 for fire modeling (Anderson 1982). &#160;</p>
        <h2>Environmental Effects on Dead Fuel Moisture</h2>
        <p>The environmental factors that determine the fuel moisture of a fuel 
 particle are:</p>
        <ul class="ul_1">
            <li class="p">
                <p>Air Temperature</p>
            </li>
            <li class="p">
                <p>Moisture content of the air (measured as relative 
	 humidity)</p>
            </li>
            <li class="p">
                <p>Solar radiation (as modified by cloud cover)</p>
            </li>
            <li class="p">
                <p>Rainfall (amount and duration)</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>These are heavily dependent on the local topographic and environmental 
 site factors for the fuel particle:</p>
        <ul class="ul_1">
            <li class="p">
                <p>Elevation</p>
            </li>
            <li class="p">
                <p>Slope</p>
            </li>
            <li class="p">
                <p>Aspect</p>
            </li>
            <li class="p">
                <p>Forest canopy cover</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>As a FlamMap conditioning period progresses, the moisture contents of 
 the four fuel size classes are adjusted for the changing weather conditions 
 over time at the local site. To do this, <span class="span_2">FARSITE</span> 
 uses the dead fuel moistures supplied from the Initial Fuel Moistures 
 (.FMS) File (for 1hr, 10hr, and 100hr time lag categories) as a starting 
 condition. Then modifies them according to the changes in temperature, 
 humidity, rainfall, and cloud cover from either the <a href="../FileTypes/PU_Weather_File.htm">Weather 
 (.WTR)</a>/<a href="../FileTypes/PU_Wind_File.htm">Wind (.WND)</a> files 
 or a <a href="../FileTypes/Weather_Stream_File.htm">Weather Stream (.WXS)</a> 
 File, combined with the local site conditions (elevation, slope, aspect, 
 canopy cover) from the Landscape (.LCP) File.</p>

        <p>The air temperature and relative humidity are modified for elevation 
 assuming a fixed lapse rate (Rothermel et al. 1986). Solar radiation is 
 modified for slope steepness and orientation and reduced by the percentage 
 of canopy cover and cloud cover specified for the time period specified 
 in the Wind (.WND) or Weather Stream (.WXS) File. Rainfall is assumed 
 constant throughout the time period specified in the Weather (.WTR) or 
 Weather Stream (.WXS) File. &#160;&#160;</p>
        <p>To account for the spatial variation in local site conditions (from 
 the Landscape (.LCP) File), FlamMap generates a catalogue of representative 
 fuel "particles" for all combinations of categories of each 
 site factor (elevation, slope, aspect, canopy cover) and initial moisture 
 content for each size class of fuel. &#160;This is necessary because the 
 fuel particles have a state "memory" of moisture and temperature 
 at all internal positions (within the particle) that are unique to a given 
 local site. The moisture model is used to update the moisture content 
 of each representative particle in the catalogue at each simulation time 
 step. Actual values used for calculating fire behavior at an arbitrary 
 time and point on the fire front are obtained from the catalogue by interpolation.</p>
        <h2>Modeling Dead Fuel Moisture</h2>
        <p>FlamMap has implemented a new model for calculating dead fuel moisture 
 content of 10hr fuels (Nelson 2000). As used here, it also handles other 
 fuel size-classes (1hr, 100hr, and 1000hr) with modifications by Nelson. 
 This model replaces those developed by Rothermel et al. (1986) for BEHAVE 
 (Andrews 1986) and Deeming et al. (1977) for the NFDRS (Bradshaw et al. 
 1983) as used in versions 1 ,2, &amp; 3 of <span class="span_2">FARSITE</span> 
 (Finney 1998). The new fuel moisture model (Nelson 2000) calculates the 
 exchange of water between the environment and the surface of a round wooden 
 stick and transport of water within the stick itself. The stick is assumed 
 to be without bark and located above ground. &#160;For computational efficiency, 
 the 1hr. fuel moisture in FlamMap is obtained from a calculation involving 
 the equilibrium moisture content (Bradshaw et al. 1983) instead of Nelson's 
 1hr. calculation.</p>
        <p>As implemented in FlamMap, Nelsons (2000) model is used to calculate 
 10 hr. and 100 hr. fuel moistures with time steps of 0.1 hour and 0.2 
 hour respectively for the range of dates and times specified in the conditioning 
 period. The dead fuel moistures used for the fire behavior calculations 
 are those at the end of the conditioning period.</p>
        <h2>Use of Conditioning Period</h2>
        <p>At the beginning of a FlamMap conditioning period, the dead fuels of 
 all size classes in each fuel model will not reflect the influences of 
 the local site conditions. Fuels for a particular fuel model all have 
 identical moisture contents obtained from the Initial Fuel Moistures (.FMS) 
 File regardless of where on the landscape the fire behavior is calculated. 
 The conditioning period can be set for several days to allow the catalogue 
 of fuel moistures to reflect the range of local site conditions before 
 calculating fire behavior characteristics.</p>
        <p>As the conditioning period progresses for a few hours or a day, however, 
 the moisture content of the finer fuels (1hr, 10hr) will increasingly 
 reflect the local site conditions because of their short time-lag. The 
 influence of the constant initial conditions on fire behavior varies by 
 the &#160;spatial variation in topography and canopy cover, and the length 
 of the conditioning period. The effects will be minor for landscapes with 
 little topographic variation and canopy cover. Because the short time-lag 
 fuels (1hr, 10hr) have the most influence on calculated fire behavior, 
 conditioning periods longer than a few days do not change results significantly 
 for similar weather streams. &#160;</p>
        <p>&#160;At the end of the conditioning period, the landscape will contain 
 spatial variation in dead fuel moisture with less influence of the initial 
 fuel moisture input conditions. &#160;</p>
