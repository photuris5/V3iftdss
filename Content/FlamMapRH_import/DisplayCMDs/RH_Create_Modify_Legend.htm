        <h1>
            <MadCap:keyword term="Modify Legends" />Create/Modify Legend</h1>
        <p>The "Create/Modify Legend" dialog box is used to change the 
 way the active grid theme is displayed. The "Create/Modify Legend" 
 dialog box can be displayed in several different ways;</p>
        <ol class="ol_1">
            <li class="P">clicking the active grid theme button at the top of the 
	 <a href="RH_View_Legend.htm">"Legend" dialog box</a>,</li>
            <li class="P">right-clicking a grid item in the "Tree" Pane 
	 and selecting the <span class="Code-Command">Properties</span> command, 
	 or</li>
            <li class="P">selecting the <span class="Code-Command">Add New</span> 
	 or <span class="Code-Command">Edit</span> button from the <a href="RH_Options_Menu.htm#ManagePredefinedLegends"><MadCap:keyword term="Create:Legends" /><MadCap:keyword term="Editing:Legends" />"Predefined 
	 Legends" dialog box</a>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>This is a powerful, and thus complex feature, so you should practice 
 with it before you attempt to use it with a deadline hanging over you.</p>
        <p>Although grids from the Landscape (.LCP) File are used in the discussions 
 below, the procedures apply to auxiliary and output grid themes too.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../flammaprobo_supporing/CreateMod_Legend1.png" alt="Create/Modify Legend dialog box" title="Create/Modify Legend dialog box" width="528" height="574" border="0" class="img_1" />
        </p>
        <p>To help understand how to change grid themes it helps to get some definitions 
 down first;</p>
        <ul class="ul_1">
            <li class="p">
                <p>Continuous Values - These can have an infinite number 
	 of values. A grid theme such as elevation in complex terrain is obviously 
	 a continuous value. Crown bulk densities calculated from inventory 
	 data to 3 or 4 decimal places is another example of a continuous value. 
	 Canopy cover expressed as a percent where values can range from 0-99 
	 is also a continuous value.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="p">
                <p>Class Values - Typically these have a small number 
	 of possible unique values usually expressed in categories. The fuel 
	 model grid is the most obvious. Canopy cover expressed as categories 
	 1 through 4 is another.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Some grids like slope or aspect can be thought of either way, in gentle 
 terrain there may be only a dozen or two unique values. While in mountainous 
 landscapes hundreds of values are possible. FlamMap will not let you display 
 a grid with more than 100 values as unique values.</p>
        <p>Each of the individual features in the "Create/Modify Legend" 
 dialog box is discussed in a separate heading below. Your changes will 
 display only in the "Create/Modify Legend" dialog box. They 
 do not take effect in the "Display" pane or the "Legend" 
 dialog box until you click the <span class="Code-Command">OK</span> button 
 in the "Create/Modify Legend" dialog box.</p>
        <h2>Theme:</h2>
        <p>This text box displays the name of the active grid theme you are modifying, 
 you cannot change it here. To modify the legend of another grid theme 
 you need to close the "Create/Modify Legend" dialog box and 
 select another grid as the active grid and reopen the "Create/Modify 
 Legend" dialog box.</p>
        <h2>
            <MadCap:keyword term="Output Grids:Units" />
            <MadCap:keyword term="Units" />Units:</h2>
        <p>The unit choices for the active theme are shown in the <span class="Code-Command">Units:</span> 
 drop-down list. Typically the choices are English or metric.</p>
        <h2><a name="DecimalPlaces" id="DecimalPlaces"></a>Decimal Places:</h2>
        <p>For continuous and unique values you can select how many decimal places 
 are displayed in the "Legend" and "Point Attributes" 
 dialog boxes. However, the class and category values should rarely, if 
 ever, have decimals. To change the number of decimal points displayed 
 select from the <span class="Code-Command">Decimal Places:</span> drop-down 
 list.</p>
        <h2>
            <MadCap:keyword term="Legends:Classes" /><a name="NumberClasses" id="NumberClasses"></a>Number of Classes:</h2>
        <p>If the grid variable type is continuous you can easily change the number 
 of legend classes with the <span class="Code-Command">Number of Classes:</span> 
 spin box. This creates an evenly distributed number of legend classes 
 across the data range. To create a legend with unevenly distributed classes 
 or eliminate outlying values, use the procedures described in the <a href="#ChangeNumberOfClasses">Changing 
 the Legend Classes heading</a>.</p>
        <p>You can also use the <span class="Code-Command">Number of Classes:</span> 
 spin box to modify a grid of unique values. Since this procedure eliminates 
 information a more useful method uses the procedures described in the 
 <a href="#ChangeNumberOfClasses">Changing the Legend Classes heading</a>.</p>
        <p>CAUTION: The use of evenly distributed classes can hide much of the 
 interesting information in your theme. Typically in fire behavior, the 
 information of interest is not evenly distributed, it's clustered at the 
 low end of the scale. Also a single cell or point with a very high value 
 can skew the legend. Spend the time to review the cell frequency and explore 
 different legend arrangements.</p>
        <h2>Data Range:</h2>
        <p>The high and low values of the active grid are displayed here for your 
 reference. You cannot edit these, but look carefully as you can easily 
 discover problems with units or your grid values here.</p>
        <h2>Variable Type</h2>
        <h3>Continuous Scale:</h3>
        <p>When the <span class="Code-Command">Continuous Scale</span> option button 
 is selected you can choose the number of classes in your legend with the 
 <span class="Code-Command">Number of Classes</span> spin box. Then click 
 the <span class="Code-Command">Apply</span> button to see the effects 
 in the "Create/Modify Legend" dialog box. The active grid in 
 the "Display" pane or the "Legend" dialog box are 
 not changed yet. You can continue to modify the number of classes until 
 you are satisfied with the results.</p>
        <h3>Unique Values:</h3>
        <p>When you select the <span class="Code-Command">Unique Values:</span> 
 option button and click the <span class="Code-Command">Get Unique Values</span> 
 button FlamMap displays all the unique values of the active grid theme 
 in the "Create/Modify Legend" dialog box.</p>

                <td style="width: 100%;" class="td_2">
                    <p>If 
		 there are more than 100 unique values FlamMap gives you this warning 
		 and will not let you use unique values.</p>
                </td>

        <h2>
            <MadCap:keyword term="Color Ramps" />
            <MadCap:keyword term="Legends:Ramping" /><a name="ColorRamp" id="ColorRamp"></a>Color Ramp:</h2>
        <p>From the drop-down list in the <span class="Code-Command">Color Ramp:</span> 
 text box you can select a color ramp for your legend. The default ramps 
 and any <a href="RH_Options_Menu.htm#ManageColorRamps">ones you have created</a> 
 are available. Select one of the ramps and click the apply button to see 
 the effect in the "Create/Modify Legend" dialog box. The three-color 
 ramps are very good for grids with azimuth units as 0° and 360° 
 then use the same color.</p>
        <h2>
            <MadCap:keyword term="Legends:Predefined" />
            <MadCap:keyword term="Predefined Legends" /><a name="PredefinedLegend" id="PredefinedLegend"></a>Predefined Legend:</h2>
        <p>Predefined legends are specific value class and color schemes for a 
 single theme type. Color ramps may seem similar but no value range, classes, 
 or units are included in color ramps and they can be used for any theme 
 type. There are some default color ramps in FlamMap and <a href="RH_Options_Menu.htm#ManageColorRamps">additional 
 ones can be developed and saved</a>. You can select a default or <a href="#SavePredefinedLegend">previously 
 saved predefined legend</a> from the <span class="Code-Command">Predefined 
 Legend:</span> drop-down list. The list only shows legends from the same 
 type of grids (elevation, fuel model, rate of spread, etc)</p>
        <p>Select the predefined legend from the drop-down list and click the <span class="Code-Command">Apply</span> button. The legend in the "Create/Modify 
 Legend" dialog box will change, but the "Display" pane 
 will not change until you close the dialog box with the <span class="Code-Command">OK</span> 
 button.</p>
        <p>Using predefined legends created in other projects can give strange 
 results with some theme types. For example applying a predefined legend 
 for elevation to a project it was not created in will almost always have 
 a different data range. Since the data range and units are part of the 
 predefined legend all the colors may not appear on the display. You can 
 fix this by clicking the <span class="Code-Command">Apply</span> button 
 next to the <span class="Code-Command">Number of Classes:</span> spin 
 box, you do not have to manually change the number of classes. Other theme 
 types, like aspect, where the data range is always the same can use predefined 
 legends from other projects without problems.</p>
        <h2>
            <MadCap:keyword term="Legends:Classes" /><a name="ChangeNumberOfClasses" id="ChangeNumberOfClasses"></a>Changing 
 the Legend Classes</h2>
        <p>An evenly distributed number of legend classes across the data range 
 can easily be created by using the <span class="Code-Command"><a href="#NumberClasses">Number 
 of Classes:</a></span> spin box. However for more complex modifications 
 to your legend, such as eliminating some outlying values or an unevenly 
 distributed legend you can use the features described below. Use these 
 techniques carefully as you can create some really strange legends.</p>
        <h3>Changing Class Values</h3>
        <p>You can modify the legend class boundaries simply by selecting the class 
 value and editing it from your keyboard. You can also change the number 
 of classes before changing the class boundaries.</p>
        <h3>Frequency</h3>
        <p>The <span class="Code-Command">Frequency</span> column for grid themes 
 is for information only, you cannot edit it. There are two numbers for 
 each class, the first is the number of grid cells in that class. The second 
 number (in parentheses) is the number of grid cells that match the class 
 boundary exactly. When the <span class="Code-Command">Unique Values</span> 
 option button is selected (and you haven't modified classes) the two numbers 
 will be the same.</p>
        <p>These numbers are very useful for summarising the information of a grid 
 theme, especially an output grid. Since you know the cell size (use <a href="../AnalysisCMDs/AA_Landscape.htm#LandscapeProperties">Landscape 
 Properties</a>) you can calculate the area for a class or an exact value.</p>
        <h3>Relative Length</h3>
        <p>The <span class="Code-Command">Relative Length</span> column is found 
 when modifying Wind or Spread Vector themes. The values in this column 
 control the length of the display arrows for each class, small values 
 create short arrows and larger values display longer arrows. By default 
 the relative length begins with "1" for the smallest class and 
 increments each class by one. The default increments may be hard to discern 
 in the "Display" Pane so you can change the relative length 
 values in several ways:</p>
        <ul class="ul_2">
            <li class="p">
                <p>first, you can simply select a relative length value 
	 with the cursor and change it from the keyboard,</p>
            </li>
            <li class="p">
                <p>second, you can ramp values by shift-clicking a range 
	 of rows and then right-clicking to display the short cut menu with 
	 the <span class="Code-Command">Auto Ramp</span> and <span class="Code-Command">Define 
	 Ramp</span> commands. Selecting the <span class="Code-Command">Auto 
	 Ramp</span> command will ramp the relative lengths between the existing 
	 top and bottom selected values. The <span class="Code-Command">Define 
	 Ramp</span> command gives you the opportunity to define the top and 
	 bottom values in the "Set Relative Length Ramp" dialog box 
	 before ramping.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Usually lengths of "1" or "2" are too small to discern 
 differences and values greater than "25" tend to be too big.</p>
        <h3><a name="InsertClass" id="InsertClass"></a>Insert Class Button</h3>
        <p>This button inserts a blank class above the currently selected class 
 in the "Create/Modify Legend" dialog box.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../flammaprobo_supporing/InsertClass.png" alt="Legend in Create/Modify dialog box showing new inserted class." title="Legend in Create/Modify dialog box showing new inserted class." width="416" height="290" border="0" class="img_1" />
        </p>
        <p>This new class has a blank value and is colored black. Double-click 
 the empty value box to insert a value. Then follow the techniques for 
 <a href="#ChangingColors">changing colors</a> or <a href="#ColorRamp">reapply 
 a color ramp</a>.</p>
        <h3><a name="AppendClass" id="AppendClass"></a>Append Class Button</h3>
        <p>The <span class="Code-Command">Append Class</span> button inserts a 
 blank class at the end of the legend classes in the "Create/Modify 
 Legend" dialog box. This new class has a blank value and is colored 
 black. Double-click the empty value box to insert a value. Sort the classes, 
 if needed, before <a href="#ChangingColors">changing colors</a> or <a href="#ColorRamp">reapplying a color ramp</a>.</p>
        <h3><a name="DeleteClass" id="DeleteClass"></a>Delete Class Button</h3>
        <p>This button deletes the currently selected class from the "Create/Modify 
 Legend" dialog box. You can select a range of classes to delete by 
 selecting one class and then Shift-clicking a second class to select all 
 the classes between the two selected classes.</p>
        <h3>Sort Classes Button</h3>
        <p>After making several modifications to your legend in the "Create/Modify 
 Legend" dialog box you can end up with quite a mess. Click the <span class="Code-Command">Sort Classes</span> button to rearrange your 
 classes into ascending order again. You will also have to reapply any 
 <a href="#ColorRamp">Color Ramp</a> you have assigned to the legend. A 
 Predefined Legend will no longer apply to the new legend so you will need 
 to create a new Predefined Legend after re-sorting.</p>
        <h2>
            <MadCap:keyword term="Legends:Colors" /><a name="ChangingColors" id="ChangingColors"></a>Changing Legend Colors</h2>
        <p>You're not stuck with the color choices in the <span class="Code-Command">Color

 dialog box or use the ramping techniques described below.</p>
        <h3><a name="ColorPicker" id="ColorPicker"></a>Color Picker</h3>
        <p>To change an individual color, display the "Color" dialog

        <p>In addition to using the default color ramps in FlamMap, you can create 
 your own. First change the color of the two ends of your ramp end points
