        <h1>Modify Vector Display</h1>
        <p>FlamMap Spread, Wind, and Max Spot Vectors are point <a href="../FileTypes/PU_Shapefiles.htm">shapefiles</a> 
 and contain attributes (in the .dbf file) that are used in the display. 
 Thus the display properties and legending of these shapefiles is different 
 from other shapefiles in FlamMap.</p>

        <h2>Theme:</h2>
        <p>The <span class="Code-Command">Theme:</span> text box displays the name 
 of the active theme you are modifying, you cannot change it here. To modify 
 the legend of another theme you need to close this "Vector Legend" 
 dialog box and select another theme as the active grid and reopen the 
 "Legend" dialog box with the <span class="Code-Command">Properties</span> 
 command.</p>
        <h2>Data Range:</h2>
        <p>The high and low values of the active theme are displayed here for your 
 reference. You cannot edit these, but look carefully as you can easily 
 discover problems with your theme.</p>
        <h2>Vector Output</h2>
        <p>The <span class="Code-Command">Vector Output</span><MadCap:keyword term="Auxiliary Themes:Wind Vectors" /> Section controls 
 the width and spacing of the arrows depicting the Spread or Wind Vectors. 
 Modifying he color and length of the arrows is described below.</p>
        <h3>Line Width</h3>
        <p>The Line Width spin box controls the width of the display arrows. It 
 refers to pixels so the actual width depends on your screen resolution. 
 Typically if the default of 1 is too small a value of 2 or 3 will create 
 easier to see arrows.</p>
        <h3>Display Density</h3>
        <p>Showing an arrow for each output grid cell can create a very confusing 
 display. There are 2 ways you can control the density of arrows on the 
 display.</p>
        <ul class="ul_2">
            <li class="p">
                <p>Selecting the <span class="Code-Command">Auto</span> 
	 radio button maintains the arrows at a fixed spacing regardless of 
	 how much you zoom in or out. You control the spacing with the <span class="Code-Command">Target Size (Pixels):</span> spin box. So as 
	 you zoom in you will see additional detail (more arrows per area) 
	 and zooming out will reduce the detail. However the Vectors (arrows) 
	 are based on the underlying grids (ROS and Max Spread Direction for 
	 Spread Vectors, Velocity and Azimuth for Wind Vectors) so the density 
	 of arrows will not exceed one per grid cell.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="p">
                <p>The <span class="Code-Command">Manual</span> radio 
	 button allows you to keep the display arrows at a constant density, 
	 regardless of the zoom. You control the density with the Rows/Cols 
	 to Skip: spin box. The default value of "0" places an arrow 
	 in the center of every underlying grid cell, a "1" skips 
	 every other cell, "2" skips two cells, etc.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Text Output</h2>
        <p>You can display the magnitude (speed) of each arrow in the <span class="Code-Command">Text 
 Output</span> section. Select the <span class="Code-Command">Output Speed</span> 
 check box to display the speed value next to each arrow in your display. 
 You can control the text size and precision with the <span class="Code-Command">Font 
 Point Size:</span> and <span class="Code-Command">Decimal Places:</span> 
 spin boxes.</p>
        <h2>Units:</h2>
        <p>The unit choices for the active theme are shown in the <span class="Code-Command">Velocity 
 Units:</span> drop-down list. For Wind Vectors the velocity units are 
 miles per hour, Spread Vectors units are meters per minute, and Max Spot 
 units are meters. Unlike the grid themes these units cannot be changed.</p>
        <p>Note: A quick approximation for chains per hour is to multiply meters 
 per minute by 3. You can quickly convert mph to km/h by multiplying by 
 1.6.</p>
        <h2>Number of Classes:</h2>
        <p>You can easily change the number of legend classes with the <span class="Code-Command">Number 
 of Classes:</span> spin box. This creates an evenly distributed number 
 of legend classes across the data range. To create a legend with unevenly 
 distributed classes or eliminate outlying values, use the procedures described 
 in the <a href="RH_Create_Modify_Legend.htm#ChangeNumberOfClasses">Changing 
 the Legend Classes</a>.</p>
        <p>CAUTION: The use of evenly distributed classes can hide much of the 
 interesting information in your theme. Typically in fire behavior, the 
 information of interest is not evenly distributed, it's clustered at the 
 low end of the scale. Also a single cell or point with a very high value 
 can skew the legend. Spend the time to explore different legend arrangements.</p>
        <h2>
            <MadCap:keyword term="Editing:Legends" />Legend Colors, Predefined Legends, &amp; Color Ramps</h2>
        <p><a href="RH_Create_Modify_Legend.htm#ChangingColors">Changing colors</a> 
 and using a <span class="Code-Command"><a href="RH_Create_Modify_Legend.htm#PredefinedLegend">Predefined 
 Legend</a></span> or <span class="Code-Command"><a href="RH_Create_Modify_Legend.htm#ColorRamp">Color 
 Ramp</a></span> for Wind/Spread Vectors is identical to the methods used 
 for grid themes.</p>
        <h2>Relative Length</h2>
        <p>The <span class="Code-Command">Relative Length</span> values control 
 the length of the display arrows for each class, small values create short 
 arrows and larger values display longer arrows. By default the relative 
 length begins with "1" for the smallest class and increments 
 each class by one. The default increments may be hard to discern in the 
 "Display" Pane so you can change the relative length values 
 in several ways:</p>
        <ul class="ul_2">
            <li class="p">
                <p>first, you can simply select a relative length value 
	 with the cursor and change it from the keyboard,</p>
            </li>
            <li class="p">
                <p>second, you can ramp values by shift-clicking a range 
	 of rows and then right-clicking to display the short cut menu with 
	 the <span class="Code-Command">Auto Ramp</span> and <span class="Code-Command">Define 
	 Ramp</span> commands. Selecting the <span class="Code-Command">Auto 
	 Ramp</span> command will ramp the relative lengths between the existing 
	 top and bottom selected values. The <span class="Code-Command">Define 
	 Ramp</span> command gives you the opportunity to define the top and 
	 bottom values in the "Set Relative Length Ramp" dialog box 
	 before ramping.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Usually lengths of "1" or "2" are too small to discern 
 differences and values greater than "25" tend to be too big.</p>
        <h2>The OK Button</h2>
        <p>To close the "Spread Vector Legend" dialog box after you have 
 made your changes, click the <span class="Code-Command">OK</span> button 
 at the bottom of the dialog box. The&#160;"Display" pane will 
 now reflect your changes.</p>
