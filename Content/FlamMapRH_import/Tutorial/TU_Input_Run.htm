        <h1 class="SubTitle">Basic Lesson 4</h1>
        <h1 class="h1_1">Input a Run</h1>
        <p>This lesson will lead you through a simple FlamMap run where you will create flame length, rate-of-spread (ROS), and crown fire activity maps. While this lesson shows you the simplest way to generate FlamMap output, the optional input and output settings are also easy. In the optional last lesson of the tutorial wind (.WND) and weather (.WTR) files are provided so you can utilize the fuel moisture model in FlamMap and produce additional fuel moisture output maps.</p>
        <h2>Open your Project</h2>
        <p>If you have closed your project or shut down FlamMap, you can reopen the project by selecting the <span class="Code-Command">File &gt; Open</span> command from the menu bar. In the "Open" dialog box select the file Tutorial.fmp and click the <span class="Code-Command">Open</span> button. Your FlamMap project will display just the way it was when you last saved it.</p>
        <p>Do some changes to your project window as shown below. Make the Fuel Model theme the active grid theme and make the "tree" pane taller so there is some space below the last item. You will be adding more items to the tree in this lesson.</p>
        <p class="Monospace">

        </p>
        <h2>The Inputs Tab</h2>
        <p>Right-click on the <span class="Code-Command">Runs</span> line (currently the bottom item) in the "Tree" pane to display this shortcut menu:</p>
        <table cellspacing="0" width="100%" class="table_1">
            <col width="89" />
            <col style="width: 100%;" />
            <tr class="tr_1">
                <td width="89">
                    <p>
                        <img src="../flammaprobo_supporing/ShortCut_NewRun.gif" alt="New Run shortcut menu" title="New Run shortcut menu" width="89" height="66" border="0" class="img_1" />
                    </p>
                </td>
                <td style="width: 100%;" class="td_24">
                    <p>Select the <span class="Code-Command">New Run</span> command from the shortcut menu to open the "Run:New Run" dialog box.</p>
                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <p>
            <img src="../flammaprobo_supporing/NewRun.gif" alt="New Run dialog box" title="New Run dialog box" width="455" height="594" border="0" class="img_1" />
        </p>
        <p>First thing; change the <span class="Code-Command">Run Name:</span> to "First Tutorial". If you keep accepting the default "New Run" name, it won't take long to get lost in a pile of "New Runs".</p>
        <h3>Fuel Moisture Files</h3>
        <p>In the <span class="Code-Command">Fuel Moisture Files</span> area of the <span class="Code-Command">Input</span> tab click the Browse button <img src="../flammaprobo_supporing/Button_Browse.gif" alt="Browse files button" title="Browse files button" width="24" height="16" border="0" class="img_1" />. An "Open" dialog box appears, navigate to the C:\...FlamMap3\Tutorial\ folder and select the Broad.FMS file and click the <span class="Code-Command">Open</span> button.</p>
        <p>There are no custom fuel models in this landscape so you can ignore the <span class="Code-Command">Use Custom Fuels (*.fmd)</span> option. Your <span class="Code-Command">Fuel Moisture Files</span> area will look like this;</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../flammaprobo_supporing/Section_FuelMoistFiles.gif" alt="Fuel Moisture Files section of the Run:New Run dialog box" title="Fuel Moisture Files section of the Run:New Run dialog box" width="417" height="70" border="0" class="img_1" />
        </p>
        <h3>Winds</h3>
        <p>In the <span class="Code-Command">Winds</span> group make sure the <span class="Code-Command">Wind Blowing Uphill</span> radio button is selected and change the <span class="Code-Command">Wind Speed (MPH @ 20'):</span> spin box to "35". Remember these are the winds 20 feet above the tops of the tree crowns.</p>
        <p>With the <span class="Code-Command">Wind Blowing Uphill</span> radio button selected the wind direction used in the fire behavior calculations will be based on the aspect theme for each cell in the landscape. Adjacent cells where sharp changes in topography occur may have very different wind directions, and thus very different fire behavior. Your <span class="Code-Command">Winds</span> group will look like this;</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../flammaprobo_supporing/Section_Winds.gif" alt="Winds section with 35 MPH uphill wind" title="Winds section with 35 MPH uphill wind" width="419" height="118" border="0" class="img_1" />
        </p>
        <h3>Canopy Characteristics</h3>
        <p>Since Stand Height, Canopy Base Height, and Canopy Bulk Density are all included in the Tutorial.LCP landscape file, those spin boxes are dimmed in this area. If these themes are not included in your Landscape (.LCP) File they can be set globally (across the entire landscape) in this group box.</p>
        <p>The <span class="Code-Command">Foliar Moisture Content (%):</span> spin box default is 100, this is a realistic moisture content for conifer foliage during an above average fire season. The <span class="Code-Command">Canopy Characteristics</span> area will look like this;</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../flammaprobo_supporing/Section_CanopyChar.gif" alt="Canopy Characteristics section with Foliar Moisture of 100%" title="Canopy Characteristics section with Foliar Moisture of 100%" width="424" height="81" border="0" class="img_1" />
        </p>
        <h3>Fuel Moisture Settings</h3>
        <p>In the <span class="Code-Command">Fuel Moisture Settings</span> group box make sure the <span class="Code-Command">Use Fixed Fuel Moistures from Fuel Moisture File</span> radio button is selected. The remaining options in this group are related to using the fuel moisture model and will not be used here.</p>
        <h2>The Outputs Tab</h2>
        <p>You select which grids you want FlamMap to generate on the <span class="Code-Command">Outputs</span> tab. In addition there are two processing options you need to be concerned with.</p>
        <h3>Processor Usage</h3>
        <p>Unless you have a computer with more than one processor chip, you can't change the <span class="Code-Command">Single Thread</span> spin box setting. If you don't know how many processors your computer has, leave the <span class="Code-Command">Single Thread</span> spin box set to the default, which is the maximum number your computer has.</p>
        <h3>Memory/Disk Usage</h3>
        <p>Leave the default <span class="Code-Command">Create outputs in memory</span> radio button selected.</p>
        <h3>Output Grids</h3>
        <p>In the Output Grids group box select the following check boxes;</p>
        <ul class="ul_1">
            <li class="kadov-p">Rate of Spread (ROS)</li>
            <li class="kadov-p">Flame Length (FML)</li>
            <li class="kadov-p">Crown Fire Activity (CFR)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Since you are using fixed fuel moistures from the Fuel Moisture (.FMS) File, none of the <span class="Code-Command">Fuel Moisture Outputs</span> are available.</p>
        <h3>Non-Fixed Fuel Moisture Outputs</h3>
        <p>These outputs are available only when a conditioning period is used, this is covered in the <a href="TU_Optional_Lesson.htm">Variable Fuel Moistures advanced lesson</a>.</p>
        <h3>Crown Fire Calculation Method</h3>
        <p>Leave the Finney (1988) radio button selected. <a href="../Runs/Fire_Behavior_Outputs_Tab.htm#CrownFireCalculation" target="_popup">More information on this option</a> is found in the help system.</p>
        <h3>Options</h3>
        <p>Make sure the default <span class="Code-Command">Relative Spread Direction from Maximum</span> radio button is selected in the <span class="Code-Command">Options</span> group box.</p>
        <p>Now your <span class="Code-Command">Output</span> tab should look like this;</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../flammaprobo_supporing/NewRun_Output.gif" alt="Outputs tab of New Run dialog box" title="Outputs tab of New Run dialog box" width="455" height="594" border="0" class="img_1" />
        </p>
        <h3>Almost Ready to Run</h3>
        <p>Since you have selected options that will generate a valid FlamMap run, the <span class="Code-Command">Apply</span> button is now available. Before any of the options in the "Run:" dialog box take effect in a FlamMap run, they need to be applied. Click the <span class="Code-Command">Apply</span> button and the <span class="Code-Command">Launch</span> button becomes available, while the <span class="Code-Command">Apply</span> button is now dimmed and the messages on the status bar change. If you make any changes to the <span class="Code-Command">Inputs</span> or <span class="Code-Command">Outputs</span> tabs the <span class="Code-Command">Apply</span> button again becomes available.</p>
        <p>Click to <span class="Code-Command">OK</span> button in the "Run:" dialog box to close it, if you have previously clicked the <span class="Code-Command">Apply</span> button all the settings in the "Run:" dialog box will be saved.</p>
        <h2>Save the Project</h2>
        <p>Even if you plan to continue now with this tutorial, you should <a href="TU_Load_LCP_and_Themes.htm#Saving%20a%20Project">save this project</a> by following the procedures in the first lesson. Keep the project name Tutorial.fmp.</p>
        <p>The next lesson will finally <a href="TU_View_Outputs.htm">generate maps in a FlamMap run</a>.</p>
