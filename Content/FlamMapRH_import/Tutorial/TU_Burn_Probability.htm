        <h1>Burn Probability</h1>
        <p>The minimum travel time (MTT) feature is a two-dimensional fire growth model. &#160;It calculates fire growth and behavior by searching for the set of pathways with minimum fire spread times from point, line or polygon ignition sources. MTT has a wide variety of uses, in this lesson you will learn how to use MTT to calculate a <a href="../Tech_Topics/Tech_MTT.htm#BurnProbability">conditional burn probability</a> for a landscape under a constant set of wind and fuel moisture conditions. Burn probabilities can be useful for comparing the effectiveness of fuel or hazard reduction projects.</p>
        <p>A separate lesson using the MTT two-dimensional fire growth feature is also available, it is not necessary to complete this lesson before doing the <a href="TU_MTT.htm">MTT fire growth lesson</a>.</p>
        <p>The Minimum Travel Time (MTT) and Treatment Optimization features in FlamMap v. 3 can be very computer intensive. However this tutorial is designed to work in a reasonable time on a computer with the recommended requirements found on the FlamMap website. (Pentium 4 processor, 256 MB RAM, and Windows 2000 operating system)</p>
        <p>The data files for this tutorial are found in your ...FlamMap3\Tutorial\Schley\ folder (directory).</p>
        <p>When you first start FlamMap it opens a default project window named "FlamMap1". If you have been working on other FlamMap projects, create an new empty project window with the <span class="Code-Command"><a href="../AnalysisCMDs/FM_Project.htm#NewProject">File &gt; New</a></span> command. It will have a name of "FlamMap2", "FlamMap3", etc.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <h2>Load a Landscape (.LCP) File</h2>
        <p>The first step is to load a Landscape (.LCP) File into the empty project; right-clicking on the <span class="span_1">?</span><span class="Code-Command">No Landscape File</span> item brings up a shortcut menu with just the <span class="Code-Command">Open</span> and <span class="Code-Command">Help</span> commands.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../flammaprobo_supporing/LeftPane3.gif" alt="Shortcut menu to open a Landscape File" title="Shortcut menu to open a Landscape File" width="429" height="244" border="0" class="img_1" />
        </p>
        <p>Select the <span class="Code-Command">Open</span> command from the shortcut menu to open a standard Window's "Open" dialog box. Navigate to the ...FlamMap3\Tutorial\Schley\ folder and select schley_pre.LCP as your Landscape (.LCP) File and click the <span class="Code-Command">Open</span> button. Your project window will look like this. To match the fuel model colors used in this tutorial <a href="../DisplayCMDs/RH_Create_Modify_Legend.htm#PredefinedLegend">select the <span class="Code-Command">Standard13</span> predefined legend</a>.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <h2>The Inputs Tab</h2>
        <p>For an MTT run using the <span class="Code-Command">Inputs Tab</span> is identical to other FlamMap runs. Like all FlamMap runs you can utilize wind grids and conditioning periods, but this lesson will use simple wind and weather inputs. Fill in the <span class="Code-Command">Inputs</span> tab as shown below.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../flammaprobo_supporing/TU_Burn_InputTab1.gif" alt="Input tab of the Run: dialog box with burn probability inputs." title="Input tab of the Run: dialog box with burn probability inputs." width="455" height="594" border="0" class="img_1" />
        </p>
        <p>It is important to emphasize one of the major FlamMap assumptions at this point; all wind and fuel moisture conditions are constant. When a conditioning period is not utilized they do not even vary by aspect, elevation, or shading. In this run FlamMap will use the fuel moisture values in the Fuel Moisture (.fms) File for all calculations.</p>
        <p>Make sure to click the <span class="Code-Command">Apply</span> button before moving on to the next step.</p>
        <h2>The Minimum Travel Time Tab</h2>
        <p>Next select the <span class="Code-Command">Minimum Travel Time</span> tab in the "Run:" dialog box.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../flammaprobo_supporing/TU_MTT_tab_blank.gif" alt="Blank MTT tab" title="Blank MTT tab" width="455" height="594" border="0" class="img_1" />
        </p>
        <h3>Ignitions</h3>
        <p>Select the <a href="../Runs/Minimum_Travel_Time_Tab.htm#RandomIgnitions"><span class="Code-Command">Random</span> radio button</a> in the <span class="Code-Command">Ignitions</span> section.</p>
        <h3>Inputs</h3>
        <ul class="ul_2">
            <li class="p">
                <p>Set the <span class="Code-Command"><a href="../Runs/Minimum_Travel_Time_Tab.htm#NodeResolution">Resolution of calculations</a></span> to 60.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="p">
                <p>Set the <span class="Code-Command"><a href="../Runs/Minimum_Travel_Time_Tab.htm#MaxSimTime">Maximum Simulation Time</a></span> to 600 minutes to simulate a two day fire with a five hour per day burning period.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Outputs</h3>
        <p>The <a href="../FileTypes/Burn_Probabilities.htm">Burn Probabilities grid</a> is the only available output when the <span class="Code-Command">Random</span> radio button is selected.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../flammaprobo_supporing/TU_Burn_MTTtab2.gif" alt="MTT tab with burn probability settings." title="MTT tab with burn probability settings." width="455" height="594" border="0" class="img_1" />
        </p>
        <h3>Launch</h3>
        <p>Now click the <span class="Code-Command">Apply</span> button and the <span class="Code-Command">Launch</span> button become active if the required inputs and settings have been made. However making sure the inputs and settings are correct is the responsibility of the user.</p>
        <p>Click the <span class="Code-Command">Launch</span> button to begin the run and display the "FlamMap Progress..." dialog box.</p>
        <h2>Outputs</h2>
        <p>Close the "FlamMap Progress..." dialog box, the "Run:" dialog box, and expand the <span class="Code-Command">Basic MTT</span> run item (by clicking the <img src="../flammaprobo_supporing/PlusButtonx2.gif" alt="" width="14" height="14" border="0" class="img_1" /> icon) in the "Tree" pane to show the output items. Select the <span class="Code-Command">Burn Probabilities</span> item so it is displayed.</p>
        <p>The <a href="../FileTypes/PU_OUT_Max_Spread_Dir.htm">Max Spread Direction</a> and <a href="../FileTypes/PU_OUT_Elliptical_Dimen.htm">Elliptical Dimensions</a> outputs are designed as inputs for other applications and will not be discussed in this lesson. You can find out more on these grids by clicking on the above links.</p>

        </p>
        <p>The default random colors don't show much information for the <span class="Code-Command">Burn Probabilities</span> item so the Legend needs to be changed. Right click on the <span class="Code-Command">Burn Probabilities</span> item and select the <span class="Code-Command">Properties</span> command from the shortcut menu to display the "Create/Modify Legend" dialog box.</p>
        <p>From the <span class="Code-Command">Color Ramp:</span> drop-down list, select one of the available ramps, a three color purple/grey/pink ramp is used for the example. Click the <span class="Code-Command">Apply</span> button next to the selected ramp and the "Create/Modify Legend" dialog box will look similar the example below.</p>
        <p>

        <p>For more on MTT Burn Probabilities feature see the <a href="../Runs/Minimum_Travel_Time_Tab.htm#RandomIgnitions">Random Ignitions section</a> in the Minimum Travel Time Tab topic and the <a href="../Tech_Topics/Tech_MTT.htm#BurnProbability">Technical Topic, Minimum Travel Time</a>.</p>
        <h2>Extra Credit</h2>
        <p>If you want to compare this burn probability run with one from a "treated" landscape you can use the schley_max.LCP, also found in the ...FlamMap3\Tutorial\Schley\ folder, as your Landscape (.LCP) File. Make sure you keep all the settings the same and use the same legend to view the outputs.</p>
