        <h1>Minimum Travel Time</h1>
        <p>The minimum travel time (MTT) feature is a two-dimensional fire growth model. &#160;It calculates fire growth and behavior by searching for the set of pathways with minimum fire spread times from point, line or polygon ignition sources. MTT has a wide variety of uses, in this lesson you will learn how to use MTT to simulate a fire from a point source ignition under a constant set of wind and fuel moisture conditions. A separate lesson using the MTT Burn Probabilities feature is also available, it is not necessary to complete this lesson before doing the <a href="TU_Burn_Probability.htm">Burn Probability Lesson</a>.</p>
        <p>The Minimum Travel Time (MTT) and Treatment Optimization features in FlamMap v. 3 can be very computer intensive. However this tutorial is designed to work in a reasonable time on a computer with the recommended requirements found on the FlamMap website. (Pentium 4 processor, 256 MB RAM, and Windows 2000 operating system)</p>
        <p>The data files for this tutorial are found in your ...FlamMap3\Tutorial\Schley\ folder (directory).</p>
        <p>When you first start FlamMap it opens a default project window named "FlamMap1". If you have been working on other FlamMap projects, create an new empty project window with the <span class="Code-Command"><a href="../AnalysisCMDs/FM_Project.htm#NewProject" target="_popup">File &gt; New</a></span> command. It will have a name of "FlamMap2", "FlamMap3", etc.</p>

        </p>
        <h2>Load a Landscape (.LCP) File</h2>
        <p>The first step is to load a Landscape (.LCP) File into the empty project; right-clicking on the <span class="span_1">?</span><span class="Code-Command">No Landscape File</span> item brings up a shortcut menu with just the <span class="Code-Command">Open</span> and <span class="Code-Command">Help</span> commands.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../flammaprobo_supporing/LeftPane3.gif" alt="Shortcut menu to open a Landscape File" title="Shortcut menu to open a Landscape File" width="429" height="244" border="0" class="img_1" />
        </p>
        <p>Select the <span class="Code-Command">Open</span> command from the shortcut menu to open a standard Window's "Open" dialog box. Navigate to the ...FlamMap3\Tutorial\Schley\ folder and select schley_pre.LCP as your Landscape (.LCP) File and click the <span class="Code-Command">Open</span> button. Your project window will look like this. To match the fuel model colors used in this tutorial <a href="../DisplayCMDs/RH_Create_Modify_Legend.htm#PredefinedLegend">select the <span class="Code-Command">Standard13</span> predefined legend</a>.</p>

        </p>
        <h2>The Inputs Tab</h2>
        <p>For an MTT run using the <span class="Code-Command">Inputs Tab</span> is identical to other FlamMap runs. Like all FlamMap runs you can utilize wind grids and conditioning periods, but this lesson will use simple wind and weather inputs. Fill in the <span class="Code-Command">Inputs</span> tab as shown below.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../flammaprobo_supporing/TU_MTT_InputTab1.gif" alt="Input tab with MTT settings" title="Input tab with MTT settings" width="455" height="594" border="0" class="img_1" />
        </p>
        <p>It is important to emphasize one of the major FlamMap assumptions at this point; all wind and fuel moisture conditions are constant. When a conditioning period is not utilized they do not even vary by aspect, elevation, or shading. In this run FlamMap will use the fuel moisture values in the Fuel Moisture (.fms) File for all calculations.</p>
        <p>Make sure to click the <span class="Code-Command">Apply</span> button before moving on to the next step.</p>
        <h2>The Minimum Travel Time Tab</h2>
        <p>Next select the <span class="Code-Command">Minimum Travel Time</span> tab in the "Run:" dialog box.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../flammaprobo_supporing/TU_MTT_tab_blank.gif" alt="Blank MTT tab" title="Blank MTT tab" width="455" height="594" border="0" class="img_1" />
        </p>
        <h3>Ignitions</h3>
        <p>For an MTT ignition you can use an existing shapefile made elsewhere or <a href="../Runs/Minimum_Travel_Time_Tab.htm#MTTIgnitions">create a shapefile</a> in FlamMap. For this run we will use an existing shapefile named start2.shp. Make sure the <span class="Code-Command">From File</span> radio button is selected and click the <img src="../flammaprobo_supporing/Button_Open_File.gif" alt="Inputs tab Open File button" title="Inputs tab Open File button" width="24" height="20" border="0" class="img_1" /> button. In the "Open" dialog box navigate to ...FlamMap3\Tutorial\Schley\ folder and select the start2.shp file.</p>
        <h3>Inputs</h3>
        <ul class="ul_2">
            <li class="p">
                <p>Set the <span class="Code-Command"><a href="../Runs/Minimum_Travel_Time_Tab.htm#NodeResolution" target="_popup">Resolution of calculations</a></span> to 60.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="p">
                <p>Set the <span class="Code-Command"><a href="../Runs/Minimum_Travel_Time_Tab.htm#MaxSimTime" target="_popup">Maximum Simulation Time</a></span> to 600 minutes to simulate a two day fire with a five hour per day burning period.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="p">
                <p>Change the <span class="Code-Command"><a href="../Runs/Minimum_Travel_Time_Tab.htm#PathInterval" target="_popup">Interval for Minimum Travel Paths</a></span> to 300.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Outputs</h3>
        <p>Click the <span class="Code-Command">Select All</span> button. We'll be looking at all the possible MTT outputs.</p>
        <p>Make sure to click the <span class="Code-Command">Apply</span> button and your "Run:" dialog box should look like this.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../flammaprobo_supporing/TU_MTT_tab_Launch.gif" alt="MTT tab, ready to Launch run" title="MTT tab, ready to Launch run" width="455" height="594" border="0" class="img_1" />
        </p>
        <p>Notice the messages at the bottom, if after you click the <span class="Code-Command">Apply</span> button the Launch button is not active these messages can give you a hint of the missing parts of your run.</p>
        <h3>Launch</h3>
        <p>Click the <span class="Code-Command">Launch</span> button and the "FlamMap Progress..." dialog box appears.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../flammaprobo_supporing/TU_MTT_ProgressBar.gif" alt="MTT run Progress... dialog box" title="MTT run Progress... dialog box" width="372" height="204" border="0" class="img_1" />
        </p>
        <p>When the run is completed, click the <span class="Code-Command">OK</span> button to return to the "Run:" dialog box. Now click the <span class="Code-Command">OK</span> button in the "Run:" dialog box to return to the "Project" window where you can view the outputs of the run.</p>
        <h2>Outputs</h2>
        <p>After closing the "Run:" dialog box the "Project" window will look like this.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../flammaprobo_supporing/TU_MTT_Project2.gif" alt="Project window after completing run" title="Project window after completing run" width="862" height="571" border="0" class="img_1" />
        </p>
        <p>Now expand the <span class="Code-Command">Basic MTT</span> run item (by clicking the <img src="../flammaprobo_supporing/PlusButtonx2.gif" alt="" width="14" height="14" border="0" class="img_1" /> icon) in the "Tree" pane to show all the output items.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../flammaprobo_supporing/TU_MTT_Project3.gif" alt="View of all output items in the Project window" title="View of all output items in the Project window" width="863" height="572" border="0" class="img_1" />
        </p>
        <p>You should save the project at this point with the <span class="Code-Command">File &gt; SaveAs</span> command. Select a name for the project, don't just use the default FlamMap1 name, and remember the directory where you saved it. Then open the <a href="TU_MTT_Outputs.htm">Evaluating MTT Outputs lesson</a> to further explore the results of this run.</p>
