        <h1>Evaluating MTT Outputs</h1>
        <p>This lesson gives you some tricks for viewing and interpreting MTT outputs. It uses the outputs generated in the <a href="TU_MTT.htm">Minimum Travel Time lesson</a>, the four vector and 10 grid output items are all the available MTT output. You do not necessarily have to use the Schley data for this lesson, you can use outputs from a different landscape, just be sure you have all the output themes. This lesson assumes you have some experience using FlamMap to modify legends, changing units, and displaying different themes. If you do not have these skills, first complete the <a href="TU_Load_LCP_and_Themes.htm">Basic Lessons</a>. If you need to review these skills you can click on the blue links in this lesson as you need to, which refer to the online help system.</p>
        <p>After completing the run, closing the "Run:" dialog box, and expanding the run item in the "Tree" pane your project window will look like this. &#160;</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>As you may have noticed from the previous lesson only seven output item are available to be selected on the <span class="Code-Command">Minimum Travel Time</span> tab of the "Run:" dialog box. The following seven output items are also generated for every MTT run;</p>
        <ul class="ul_2">
            <li class="p">
                <p>Minimum Travel Time Ignitions</p>
            </li>
            <li class="p">
                <p>Rate of Spread</p>
            </li>
            <li class="p">
                <p>Fireline Intensity</p>
            </li>
            <li class="p">
                <p>Max Spread Direction</p>
            </li>
            <li class="p">
                <p>Elliptical Dimension a</p>
            </li>
            <li class="p">
                <p>Elliptical Dimension b</p>
            </li>
            <li class="p">
                <p>Elliptical Dimension c</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The <a href="../FileTypes/PU_OUT_Max_Spread_Dir.htm">Max Spread Direction</a> and <a href="../FileTypes/PU_OUT_Elliptical_Dimen.htm">Elliptical Dimensions</a> outputs are designed as inputs for other applications and will not be discussed in this lesson. You can find out more on these grids by clicking on the above links.</p>
        <h2>MTT Arrival Time Grid</h2>
        <p>Select the <span class="Code-Command"><a href="../FileTypes/Arrival_Time.htm#ArrivalTimeGrid">MTT Arrival Time</a></span> item so that it is the active theme in the "Display" pane.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../flammaprobo_supporing/TU_MTT_Project4.png" alt="Project window showing arrival time grid." title="Project window showing arrival time grid." width="864" height="566" border="0" class="img_1" />
        </p>
        <p>You can now easily see the perimeter of the fire simulated. <a href="../DisplayCMDs/RH_View_Menu.htm#ZoomIn">Zoom in</a> so that the simulated fire mostly fills the "Display" pane. If you view the landscape themes at this scale you will notice the cell size of the MTT Arrival Time grid is different from the landscape themes. The cell size of the four MTT grids (<span class="Code-Command">MTT ROS</span>, <span class="Code-Command">MTT FLI Map</span>, <span class="Code-Command">MTT Arrival Time</span>, and <span class="Code-Command">MTT Node Influence</span>) is determined by the <a href="../Runs/Minimum_Travel_Time_Tab.htm#NodeResolution">Resolution of Calculations</a> setting you made on the <span class="Code-Command">Minimum Travel Time</span> tab in the previous lesson, which is 60 meters in this example.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../flammaprobo_supporing/TU_MTT_Project5.png" alt="Project window with zoomed in arrival time grid." title="Project window with zoomed in arrival time grid." width="864" height="566" border="0" class="img_1" />
        </p>
        <p>Turn off (by double-clicking) the lower three vector output items; <span class="Code-Command">MTT Flow Paths</span>, <span class="Code-Command">MTT Major Paths</span>, and <span class="Code-Command">MTT Arrival Contour</span> to make viewing easier.</p>

        </p>
        <p>The red dot is the remaining <span class="Code-Command">Minimum Travel Time Ignitions</span> vector item.</p>
        <table cellspacing="0" width="100%" class="table_1">

                </td>
                <td style="width: 100%;" class="td_2">
                    <p>The default legend (<span class="Code-Command">View &gt; Legend</span> command) has the <span class="Code-Command">MTT Arrival Time</span> values sorted into 20 classes and color ramped with the darkest purple cells burning early in the simulation and the white cells burning last. The black No Data cells were not "burned" in the simulation.</p>
                    <p>The values are in approximately 30 minute classes (600 minutes/20 classes) and the <a href="../DisplayCMDs/RH_Create_Modify_Legend.htm#DecimalPlaces">decimal places have been set</a> to zero for this example.</p>
                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <h2>MTT Arrival Time Contour</h2>
        <p>Display the <span class="Code-Command"><a href="../FileTypes/Arrival_Time.htm#ArrivalTimeContour">MTT Arrival Contour</a></span> item by double-clicking. This is simply a contour of the <span class="Code-Command">MTT Arrival Time</span> grid. &#160;</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../flammaprobo_supporing/TU_MTT_Project7.png" alt="Arrival time grid with ignition and time contour vector themes displayed." title="Arrival time grid with ignition and time contour vector themes displayed." width="864" height="566" border="0" class="img_1" />
        </p>
        <table cellspacing="0" width="100%" class="table_1">
            <col width="248" />
            <col style="width: 100%;" />
            <tr class="tr_1">
                <td width="248" class="td_1">
                    <p>
                        <img src="../flammaprobo_supporing/TU_MTT_ContourProperties.gif" alt="Contour Properties dialog box for Arrival Time Contour" title="Contour Properties dialog box for Arrival Time Contour" width="248" height="236" border="0" class="img_1" />
                    </p>
                </td>
                <td style="width: 100%;" class="td_2">
                    <p>To view the contour properties right-click the <span class="Code-Command">MTT Arrival Contour</span> item in the "Tree" pane and select the <span class="Code-Command">Properties</span> command from the shortcut menu. Looking at the <span class="Code-Command">Contour Interval</span> you can see it is very close to one hour. The default contour interval is the maximum <span class="Code-Command">MTT Arrival Time</span> grid value divided by ten. In this case even though we specified a simulation time of 600 minutes, the maximum value is only 595 minutes due to rounding the simulation to the cells.</p>
                    <p>You can also <a href="../flammaprobo_supporing/AUX_VectorContour.htm#Properties">modify the color, style, &amp; width of the contours</a> with this dialog box. But to change the contour interval you need to <a href="../AnalysisCMDs/AA_Landscape.htm#CreatingContours">create a new contour</a> which will be created under the Auxiliary Themes item in the "Tree" pane.</p>
                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <p>You can look at the contours as fire progression perimeters, but remember to consider the assumptions in setting the simulation time period. In this simulation the scenario simulated was a five hour burning period for each of two days. &#160;</p>
        <h2>MTT Major Paths</h2>
        <p>Next view the <span class="Code-Command"><a href="../FileTypes/Flow_Paths_Themes.htm#MTTMajorPaths">MTT Major Paths</a></span> vector item, this is a subset of the <span class="Code-Command"><a href="../FileTypes/Flow_Paths_Themes.htm#MTTFlowPaths">MTT Flow Paths</a></span> vector item which is easier to view and interpret. The number of paths shown as major paths is controlled by the <span class="Code-Command"><a href="../Runs/Minimum_Travel_Time_Tab.htm#PathInterval">Interval for Minimum Travel Paths</a></span> setting on the <span class="Code-Command">Minimum Travel Time</span> tab.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../flammaprobo_supporing/TU_MTT_Project8.png" alt="Arrival time grid with ignition, time contour, and major path vector themes displayed." title="Arrival time grid with ignition, time contour, and major path vector themes displayed." width="864" height="566" border="0" class="img_1" />
        </p>
        <p>By displaying all paths with the <span class="Code-Command">MTT Flow Paths</span> vector item you can see how the simulated fire got to each of the arrival time cells (the upper left corner is the node). &#160;</p>
        <h2>MTT ROS Grid</h2>
        <p>Displaying the <span class="Code-Command"><a href="../FileTypes/PU_OUT_Spread_Rate.htm">MTT ROS</a></span> grid reveals a random color legend which is difficult to interpret. To <a href="../DisplayCMDs/RH_Create_Modify_Legend.htm#ColorRamp">change the legend colors</a> right-click on the <span class="Code-Command">MTT ROS</span> item in the "Tree" pane and select the <span class="Code-Command">Properties</span> command from the shortcut menu. In the "Create/Modify Legend" dialog box pick from the <span class="Code-Command">Color Ramp:</span> drop down menu, light blue to dark blue is used in the following example, and click the <span class="Code-Command">Apply</span> button.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../flammaprobo_supporing/TU_MTT_Project9.png" alt="MTT ROS grid" title="MTT ROS grid" width="864" height="566" border="0" class="img_1" />
        </p>
        <p>Notice that the major paths tend to follow the cells with higher ROS values.</p>
        <p>You may have already realized there are two rate of spread grids in this run, the <span class="Code-Command">Rate of Spread</span> item and the <span class="Code-Command">MTT ROS</span> item. Don't confuse yourself by assuming they are the same thing. View both themes and you will notice that the <span class="Code-Command">Rate of Spread</span> values are calculated for the entire landscape while the <span class="Code-Command">MTT ROS</span> values are only for the simulated fire area.</p>
        <table cellspacing="0" width="100%" class="table_1">
            <col width="294" />
            <col style="width: 100%;" />
            <tr class="tr_1">
                <td width="294" class="td_1">
                    <p>
                        <img src="../flammaprobo_supporing/TU_MTT_PointAttributes.gif" alt="Point Attributes dialog box" title="Point Attributes dialog box" width="294" height="240" border="0" class="img_1" />
                    </p>
                </td>
                <td style="width: 100%;" class="td_2">
                    <p>Before comparing individual cells for the two themes make sure they have the same units. The default units for the <span class="Code-Command">MTT ROS</span> theme are meters/minute. So select the <a href="../DisplayCMDs/RH_Create_Modify_Legend.htm"><span class="Code-Command">Properties</span> command</a> for the <span class="Code-Command">Rate of Spread</span> item and make sure the units are m/min displayed with 9 decimal places.</p>
                    <p>Display the <span class="Code-Command">MTT ROS</span> item and double-click one of the mid value cells within the simulated fire to bring up the "Point Attributes" dialog box. Select the Basic MTT tab to show all the output grid values for the point you double-clicked. You will see that the <span class="Code-Command">Rate of Spread</span> values are usually higher than the <span class="Code-Command">MTT ROS</span> values. This is because the <span class="Code-Command">Rate of Spread</span> value is the maximum rate of spread for the cell while the <span class="Code-Command">MTT ROS</span> value is for the spread direction for the path the simulated fire took through the cell. This is very obvious when you query cells in areas where the simulated fire was obviously backing downhill or into the south wind.</p>
                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <h2>MTT FLI Map</h2>
        <p>The <span class="Code-Command"><a href="../FileTypes/PU_OUT_Fireline_Intensity.htm">MTT FLI Map</a></span> displays the fireline intensity only for the simulated fire. As with the <span class="Code-Command">MTT ROS</span> grid discussed above there is a corresponding <span class="Code-Command">Fireline Intensity</span> grid for the entire landscape which is different from the <span class="Code-Command">MTT FLI Map</span> grid. The <span class="Code-Command">Fireline Intensity</span> theme show the intensity if the fire was spreading in direction of maximum spread rate while <span class="Code-Command">MTT FLI Map</span> shows the intensity with the spread direction of the simulated fire.</p>
        <p>The default legend for the <span class="Code-Command">MTT FLI Map</span> is skewed by the outlying values at the top of the scale. To make the legend more informative first delete the six highest valued categories and <a href="../DisplayCMDs/RH_Create_Modify_Legend.htm#InsertClass">insert two new classes</a> between the lowest value and the <span class="Code-Command">No Data</span> classes, give these two new categories values of 100 and 300. Apply the yellow-orange-brown <a href="../DisplayCMDs/RH_Create_Modify_Legend.htm#ColorRamp">color ramp</a> to display the example below.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../flammaprobo_supporing/TU_MTT_Project10.png" alt="MTT fire line intensity grid" title="MTT fire line intensity grid" width="864" height="566" border="0" class="img_1" />
        </p>
        <h2>MTT Node Influence Grid</h2>
        <p>The <span class="Code-Command"><a href="../FileTypes/Node_Influence.htm">MTT Node Influence</a></span> grid shows the relative importance of each cell to the spread of the fire.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../flammaprobo_supporing/TU_MTT_Project11.png" alt="MTT Node Influence grid" title="MTT Node Influence grid" width="864" height="566" border="0" class="img_1" />
        </p>
        <p>In this example the darker red cells are most important to the simulated fire spreading as it did. One way to view this theme is that when the "fire" spreads through a red cell it goes on to burn more additional cells than when the "fire" spreads through a grey cell. You can see the major paths go through the most important cells, in fact the <span class="Code-Command">MTT Major Paths</span> vector theme is derived from the <span class="Code-Command">MTT Node Influence Grid</span>.</p>
        <h2>Finally</h2>
        <p>The MTT method of simulating fires can be confusing and difficult to grasp. However it does bring us new ways of looking at fire spread which will be important in using the Treatment Optimization Model (TOM) feature in FlamMap. So take some time to further explore MTT methods, create new ignitions on the tutorial landscape, change the MTT or weather setting for this example, and try out your own landscapes. Remember any Landscape (.LCP) File, even those created outside of FlamMap, can be used for an MTT run.</p>
