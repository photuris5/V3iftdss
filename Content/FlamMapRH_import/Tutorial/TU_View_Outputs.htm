        <h1 class="h1_1">View Outputs</h1>
        <p>This is the part you all have been waiting for, getting some output to look at.</p>
        <h2>Open your Project</h2>
        <p>If you have closed your project or shut down FlamMap, you can reopen the project by selecting the <span class="Code-Command">File &gt; Open</span> command from the menu bar. In the "Open" dialog box select the file Tutorial.fmp and click the <span class="Code-Command">Open</span> button. Your FlamMap project will display just the way it was when you last saved it as shown below.</p>

        </p>
        <h2>Launch Your Run</h2>
        <p>Right-click on the <span class="Code-Command">First Tutorial</span> line in the "Tree" pane, it will be the last line in the tree. This shortcut menu is displayed;</p>
        <table cellspacing="0" width="100%" class="table_1">

                </td>
                <td style="width: 100%;" class="td_24">
                    <p>Select the <span class="Code-Command">Properties</span> command from the shortcut menu. The "Run:First Tutorial" dialog box appears, looking just like it did when you finished the <a href="TU_Input_Run.htm">previous lesson</a>.</p>
                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <p>The Status and Button bars at the bottom of the "Run:First Tutorial" dialog box should look like this;</p>

        </p>
        <p>On the button bar the <span class="Code-Command">Launch</span> button is available, the <span class="Code-Command">Apply</span> button is dimmed indicating you have made no changes to the <span class="Code-Command">Input</span> or <span class="Code-Command">Output</span> tabs.</p>
        <p>The status bar indicates you have proper inputs for a run, three maps have been requested, and there are no previous outputs from any First Tutorial runs.</p>
        <p>Now for the big moment; click the <span class="Code-Command">Launch</span> button and the following status box appears for several seconds.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../flammaprobo_supporing/StatusBar.gif" alt="Status bas showing FlamMap run progress" title="Status bas showing FlamMap run progress" width="284" height="139" border="0" class="img_1" />
        </p>
        <p>When the fire behavior calculations are complete click <span class="Code-Command">OK</span> in the run completed information box and click <span class="Code-Command">OK</span> in the "Run:First Tutorial" dialog box.</p>
        <h2>Viewing Your Outputs</h2>
        <p>Now expand the <img src="../flammaprobo_supporing/Page-Icon.gif" alt="" width="9" height="11" border="0" class="img_1" /> <span class="Code-Command">First Tutorial</span> line in the "Tree" pane by clicking it's <img src="../flammaprobo_supporing/PlusButtonx2.gif" alt="" width="14" height="14" border="0" class="img_1" /> icon and your "Tree" pane will now look similar to this;</p>
        <table cellspacing="0" width="100%" class="table_1">
            <col width="322" />
            <col style="width: 100%;" />

                    </p>
                </td>
                <td style="width: 100%;" class="td_24">
                    <p>To view your outputs just select any of the themes under the <img src="../flammaprobo_supporing/Page-Icon.gif" alt="Page icon in tree pane" title="Page icon in tree pane" width="9" height="11" border="0" class="img_1" /> <span class="Code-Command">First Tutorial</span> item and make it the active theme.</p>
                    <p>If a "Legend" window is not open, open one by right-clicking in the "Display" pane and selecting <span class="Code-Command">View Legend</span> from the shortcut menu.</p>
                    <p>You can <a href="TU_Using_Legends.htm#ModifyingGridThemeProperties">modify the legend</a> with the procedures you learned in the Using Legends lesson.</p>
                    <p>Interpreting the legends for the <span class="Code-Command">Flame Length</span> and <span class="Code-Command">Rate of Spread</span> grid themes are obvious. But the <span class="Code-Command">Crown Fire Activity</span> theme classes are defined as;</p>
                    <ol class="ol_1">
                        <li class="kadov-p">Surface Fire</li>
                        <li class="kadov-p">Passive Crown Fire (torching)</li>
                        <li class="kadov-p">Active Crown Fire</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>&#160;</p>
                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <p>For any grid cell to have a value of 2 or 3 it must also meet the lower value conditions. For example, a cell with a torching value (2) must also have surface fire activity and a active crown fire cell must also meet the conditions for torching as well as surface fire.</p>
        <h2>Saving Your Outputs</h2>
        <p>Well, you've got some FlamMap outputs and you can view them in FlamMap, but now what else can I do with them. First off you want to save your FlamMap project once again so you can return to this point in your work.</p>
        <p>You can also save your output grids as separate files you can import into a GIS, image editing software, or word processor.</p>
        <h3>Save As an Image</h3>
        <p>To save the Crown Fire Activity map as a .jpg file you can bring into a word processor right-click the <span class="Code-Command">Crown Fire Activity</span> line in the "Tree" pane.</p>
        <table cellspacing="0" width="100%" class="table_1">
            <col width="95" />
            <col style="width: 100%;" />
            <tr class="tr_1">
                <td width="95">
                    <p>
                        <img src="../flammaprobo_supporing/Shortcut_SaveAs.gif" alt="Shortcut menu for run outputs." title="Shortcut menu for run outputs." width="95" height="92" border="0" class="img_1" />
                    </p>
                </td>
                <td style="width: 100%;" class="td_24">
                    <p>Select the <span class="Code-Command">Save As...</span> command from the shortcut menu to open the "Save As" dialog box.</p>
                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <p>By default the "Save As" dialog box opens with the last folder you accessed. If it is not the &#160;...FlamMap2/Tutorial/ folder, navigate to there.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../flammaprobo_supporing/SaveAs_File_Choices.gif" alt="Save As dialog box showing file format choices" title="Save As dialog box showing file format choices" width="561" height="414" border="0" class="img_1" />
        </p>
        <p>In the <span class="Code-Command">Save as type:</span> text box open the drop down menu and select <span class="Code-Command">JPEG Files (*.jpg)</span> from the file type list. In the <span class="Code-Command">File Name:</span> text box enter "Crown_Fire" as your file name. FlamMap will automatically add the file extension.</p>
        <h3>Save As a Grid File</h3>
        <p>Saving your FlamMap output as an image does not allow you to conduct further analysis on the image. For example, you might want to know how many hectares in your analysis area will have a flame length greater than 3 meters. To do this you will need the capabilities of a GIS that can manipulate grids such as ArcInfo or ArcView/Spacial Analyst.</p>
        <p>To save your FlamMap output for use in a GIS follow the steps above to save as an image. The one difference is selecting the file type; in the <span class="Code-Command">Save as type:</span> text box use the default file type of <span class="Code-Command">Ascii Grid Files (*.asc)</span>.</p>
        <h2>Save Your Project</h2>
        <p>Even if you plan to continue on with the optional lesson, you should <a href="TU_Load_LCP_and_Themes.htm#Saving%20a%20Project">save this project</a> by following the procedures in the first lesson. Keep the project name Tutorial.fmp.</p>
        <h2>You're Finished</h2>
        <p>You now have completed this tutorial showing the basic steps in conducting a FlamMap run. In the &#160;Advanced Tutorials folder you can explore FlamMap's other features.</p>
