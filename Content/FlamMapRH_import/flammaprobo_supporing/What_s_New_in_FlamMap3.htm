        <h1>What's New in FlamMap3</h1>
        <p>FlamMap version 3.0 incorporates several new tools and features. Note that the Minimum Travel Time Fire Growth Model and Treatment Optimization are very computationally intensive and are best utilized on multi-processor computers.</p>
        <h2>Support for the Scott &amp; Burgan Fuel Models</h2>
        <p>FlamMap v3.0 supports the use of the Scott and Burgan (2005) fuel models as well continuing use of the original 13 and custom fuel models. The following section, from Scott and Burgan (2005), describes the reasons for the development of these 40 new models and may give you some indication of their potential use.</p>
        <h3>Need for Additional Fuel Models</h3>
        <p>The original 13 fire behavior fuel models are "for the severe period of the fire season when wildfires pose greater control problems..." (Anderson 1982). Those fuel models have worked well for predicting spread rate and intensity of active fires at peak of fire season in part because the associated dry conditions lead to a more uniform fuel complex, an important assumption of the underlying fire spread model (Rothermel 1972). However, they have deficiencies for other purposes, including prescribed fire, wildland fire use, simulating the effects of fuel treatments on potential fire behavior, and simulating transition to crown fire using crown fire initiation models. Widespread use of the Rothermel (1972) fire spread model and desire for more options in selecting a fuel model indicate the need for a new set of models to</p>
        <ul class="ul_2">
            <li class="p">
                <p>Improve the accuracy of fire behavior predictions outside of the severe period of the fire season, such as prescribed fire and fire use applications. For example, the original grass models 1 (short grass) and 3 (tall grass) are fully cured to represent the most severe part of the fire season. Applying those fuel models to situations in which the grass fuelbed is not fully cured (that is, outside the severe part of the fire season) leads to overprediction.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="p">
                <p>Increase the number of fuel models applicable in high-humidity areas. With the Rothermel spread model, the only way to accommodate fuel complexes that burn well at high humidity is through the moisture of extinction parameter. Only a few of the original 13 fuel models are appropriate for fuelbeds that burn well at relatively high dead fuel moistures.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="p">
                <p>Increase the number of fuel models for forest litter and litter with grass or shrub understory. Predicted surface fire behavior drives crown fire models (Van Wagner 1977, Alexander 1988), so increased precision in surface fire intensity prediction will lead to increased precision in crown fire behavior prediction and hazard assessment.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="p">
                <p>Increase the ability to simulate changes in fire behavior as a result of fuel treatment by offering more fuel model choices, especially in timber-dominated fuelbeds. This fuel model set does not attempt to directly simulate the wide variety of available fuel treatment options.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Use of Scott &amp; Burgan Fuel Models in FlamMap</h3>
        <p>These 40 additional fuel models are used just like the original 13, however make sure to use the fuel model numbers (90 - 204) in the Landscape (.LCP) and Fuel Moisture (.FMS) files, not the alpha-numeric codes (SH2, TL5, etc.).</p>
        <p>The Scott &amp; Burgan fuel models are also available in other fire behavior tools; NEXUS v2.0, FARSITE v4.1, and BehavePlus v3.0.</p>
        <h2>Crown Fire Calculation Options</h2>
        <p>There are now two options for crown fire calculations. Besides the method (Finney, 1998) used in <span class="span_2">FARSITE</span> and previous versions of FlamMap, the method used in NEXUS and FVS/FFE (Scott and Reinhardt, 2001) is also now available. This option is found on the <a href="../Runs/Fire_Behavior_Outputs_Tab.htm#CrownFireCalculation"><span class="Code-Command">Fire Behavior</span> tab</a> of the "Run:" dialog box.</p>
        <h2>Minimum Travel Time Fire Growth Model</h2>
        <p>The minimum travel time (MTT) feature is a two-dimensional fire growth model. &#160;It calculates fire growth and behavior by searching for the set of pathways with minimum fire spread times from point, line or polygon ignition sources. &#160;In theory, the results are identical to wave-front expansion used in <span class="span_2">FARSITE</span> with the exception that all weather and fuel moisture conditions are held constant over time with MTT but allowed to vary with time in <span class="span_2">FARSITE</span>.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Arrival Time contours (45 minutes each) for 7 hours from a point source ignition using MTT. &#160;</p>
        <h2>Treatment Optimization Modelling</h2>
        <p>The Treatment Optimization Modelling (TOM) calculations rely on the MTT calculations to identify major fire travel routes and attempt to block them efficiently with fuel treatments. For the target weather conditions, this translates to a specific optimization objective to find the specific treatment areas that give the greatest reduction in fire growth for the given treatment amount. In other words, it is attempting to <span class="span_2">maximize the minimum travel time</span> for fire moving across the landscape.</p>
        <p>

        </p>

        <h2>Use of Wind Grids</h2>
        <p>The use of wind speed and direction ASCII grids for calculating fire behavior outputs is available in FlamMap v3.0. These grids can be created with Computational Fluid Dynamics software (i.e. Fluent's Wind Wizard) or some weather models.</p>
        <p>The constant wind stream input method is also still available.</p>
        <h2>Wind and Spread Vectors</h2>
        <p>The Spread Vector is a combination of the Rate of Spread and Maximum Spread Direction output grids displayed as an arrow on top of the active grid. The Wind Vector is a combination of the wind speed and direction input grids displayed as an arrow.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="ProjectWindow_WindVectors.gif" alt="" width="818" height="564" border="0" class="img_1" /> &#160;</p>
        <p>&#160;The colors and lengths of the display arrows can be scaled to the Rate of Spread or Wind Speed. These vectors make it much easier to visualize fire spread and wind flows.</p>
