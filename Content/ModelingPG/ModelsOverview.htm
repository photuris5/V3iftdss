        <h1>Modeling in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> Playground</h1>
        <p>The <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> Modeling Playground is the area of <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> in which models are populated and run, and modeling outputs are stored. You may select models to run, proceed to populating and running models, view a list of completed modeling runs, and select completed modeling runs to view output summaries or spatial outputs in <MadCap:variable name="General.MapStudio" />.</p>
        <p>As of this Spring 2017 Release of <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />, modeling functions focus on fire behavior and risk assessment. Available models include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="FlamMap/FlamMapAbout.htm">FlamMap</a>
            </li>
            <li><span class="comingsoon">Behave </span>
            </li>
            <li><span class="comingsoon">Calkin Risk Assessment</span>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="alertcomingsoon" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;More Functionality to Come! &lt;/b&gt;">The IFTDSS development team is working behind the scenes to build out the modeling capabilities. These functions will become available in a future <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> releases.</p>
