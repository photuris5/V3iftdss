        <h1>Modeling in My Modeling Playground</h1>
        <p><span class="UIcomponent">My Modeling Playground</span> is the area of <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> to populate and run models. Model outputs are also available here, you may view summaries, or spatial outputs in <MadCap:variable name="General.MapStudio" />. You will find in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> that My Modeling Playground, and the models therein, can be accessed from multiple parts of <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />, such as accessing <span class="UIcomponent">Landscape Fire Behavior</span> from the <span class="UIcomponent">Landscape Evaluation</span> stage of the <span class="UIcomponent">Planning Cycle</span> for example. </p>
        <p>As of this Spring 2017 Release of <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />, modeling functions focus on landscape fire behavior. Available and future models will include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="FlamMap/FlamMapAbout.htm">Landscape Fire Behavior</a>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>The current capability of Modeling Playground is focused on fire behavior. It allows you to model various weather conditions and fuel moistures to ensure landscape fuel model parameters accurately generate  expected fire behavior model outputs based on your knowledge and experience.  This is also a place to experiment with “what if” scenarios.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><span class="comingsoon">Behave </span>
            </li>
            <li><span class="comingsoon">Burn Probability for Quantitative Risk Assessment</span>
            </li>
            <li><span class="comingsoon">And more....</span>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <div class="notificationComingSoon">
            <p>The IFTDSS development team is working behind the scenes to build out the modeling capabilities. These functions will become available in a future <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> releases.</p>
