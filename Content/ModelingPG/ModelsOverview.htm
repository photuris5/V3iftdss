        <h1>Modeling in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> Playground</h1>
        <p>The <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> Modeling Playground is the area of <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> in which models are populated and run; modeling outputs are also available here. The current capability of Modeling Playground is focused on fire behavior. It allows you to model various weather conditions and fuel moistures to ensure landscape fuel model parameters accurately generate  expected fire behavior model outputs based on your knowledge and experience.  This is also a place to experiment with “what if” scenarios.</p>
        <p>As of this Spring 2017 Release of <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />, modeling functions focus on fire behavior and risk assessment. Available models include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="FlamMap/FlamMapAbout.htm">FlamMap</a>
            </li>
            <li><span class="comingsoon">Behave </span>
            </li>
            <li><span class="comingsoon">Calkin Risk Assessment</span>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="alertcomingsoon" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;More Functionality to Come! &lt;/b&gt;">The IFTDSS development team is working behind the scenes to build out the modeling capabilities. These functions will become available in a future <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> releases.</p>
