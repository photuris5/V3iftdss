        <h1>Generating Fire Behavior Reports for an Area of Interest</h1>
        <div class="notificationComingSoon">
            <p>This is a workaround designed for user specified fire behavior inputs to produce model outputs and reports for an Area of Interest.  Future functionality in IFTDSS will allow users to run reports and model outputs for an Area of Interest within the Modeling Playground without having to go through the Develop Treatment Alternatives. This functionality is planned but specific timing for the release is uncertain at this time.</p>
        </div>
        <p>Currently <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> generates reports for existing fire behavior runs, but those are performed for an entire landscape. To perform a fire behavior run and report just for a specific Area of Interest (AOI), you need to use the Develop Treatment Alternative task. The report you want for just the  AOI is included when comparing two landscapes. Since you are not interested in the comparison part and just the report output for the AOI, you are going to “trick” the system by creating a phony landscape that is identical to your original landscape but has a different name. This will generate a report comparing fire behavior on the two identical landscapes. The information in this report is about fire behavior in the AOI using your own weather inputs.</p>
        <p>To run a fire behavior model and generate a report for a specific AOI:&#160;</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
            <li>From the <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> <span class="UIcomponent">Planning Cycle</span>, go to the <span class="UIcomponent">Strategic Planning</span> stage, and select <span class="UIcomponent">Develop Treatment Alternatives</span>. </li>
            <li>Click<span class="UIcomponent">split screen</span> <img src="../../Resources/Images/buttons_general/button_showsplitmap.png" alt="show split screen" /> to display a map area to the left and the tabs on the right, then zoom into your AOI.</li>
            <li>
                <p>Select your landscape from the <span class="UIcomponent">Select Landscape</span> drop-down list, or create one by clicking<span class="UIcomponent">Create on Map</span>. If you create a landscape here remember that the landscape extent must be larger than your AOI.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Select your <span class="UIcomponent">Area of Interest</span> from the drop-down and proceed to the <span class="UIcomponent">Editing tab</span>. </p>

            <li>Select the <span class="UIcomponent">Edit tab</span> and select your landscape.</li>
            <li>
                <p>Select <span class="UIcomponent">Add user created edit rule</span> and add the following rule. You are tricking the system to create an edited landscape, but the edit rule you are building won’t change anything:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Where elevation is greater than 0, multiply the canopy cover by 1</p>

                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Click <span class="UIcomponent">Save</span>, to save your new landscape with a name indicating that you added a rule that won’t make any changes. For example, X1 after the landscape name to indicate you multiplied by 1.</li>
            <li>
                <p>Select the <span class="UIcomponent">Input tab</span>, add the fire behavior inputs you want to use, and click <span class="UIcomponent">Save Inputs</span>.</p>

When you compare on the map, the first layer displayed is the "Landscape Change" layer. Since the rule you wrote during editing should not effect on the landscape, your "Landscape Change" layer should look similar to the one pictured below, entirely gray which indicates no change.

        <h2>View and Understand Report Outputs</h2>
        <p>Now that you have completed all of the steps to generate the reports, you are ready to view and analyze the information needed for your AOI.</p>
        <p>Below is the fire behavior report created for the AOI polygon GreatBasinShape. You can see the inputs selected are displayed. The pie chart shows the breakdown of Flame Length within the AOI polygon. </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>You'll notice two identical pie charts here. This is because the Develop Treatment Alternatives task is usually used to compare different landscape edit outcomes. However, in this case we used the tasks to select an AOI and generate a fire behavior report for our landscape, and a “phony” edited landscape, which was needed to complete this task. The duplicate charts and tables may be ignored, or you could download the data from the table within the report and build your own charts and graphs in another application such as Microsoft Excel if you choose.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Behavior/aoi_workaround_8.png" alt="report outputs showing fire behavior results" class="border" />
        </p>
        <p>This report shows the Landscape Layer Summary (Fuel Model) for just the AOI (this is indicated by the name GreatBasinShape which was the name of the polygon used for AOI in this example). Again, there are two sets of data but they are identical and the duplicate may be ignored.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Behavior/aoi_workaround_10.png" alt="bar chart display of fuel model data." class="border" />
        </p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="General.Exclude">Ignore this paragraph - currently hidden from IFTDSS Users: Now that you have the process down, you can change the Fire Behavior Inputs and run various scenarios on your AOI if you want to compare how weather inputs affect fire behavior outputs. The comparison part for Fire Behavior Inputs would have to be done outside of IFTDSS, for example, in Excel if  you wanted to make charts and graphs. You could also compare the fire behavior outputs visually in <MadCap:variable name="General.MapStudio" />using the Slider Tool.  You could also run the Auto97th Report through Landscape Summary workflow if you want to compare the 97th percentile info for the closest RAWS. You can of course compare Landscapes if you choose to make meaningful landscape edits, you would do this through the regular Develop Treatment Alternative Methods process.</p>
