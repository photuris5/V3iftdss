In 2007, the JFSP organized a project entitled "The Software Tools and Systems Study" and contracted with the Carnegie Mellon Software Engineering Institute (SEI) to perform a strategic analysis of this problem. The strategic analysis was completed in March 2008 and the SEI submitted a written report to the JFSP [Palmquist, 2008 (pdf)]. One of the key SEI findings that addressed the plethora of software tools and systems was, "The wildland fire and fuels management community needs a platform and approach that supports distributed collaboration."</p>
