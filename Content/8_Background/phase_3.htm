        <h1>Phase III:&#160;Implementation of a Proof-of-Concept Version of IFTDSS (May 2009 - April 2010)</h1>
        <p>Phase II of the JFSP Software and Tools Systems study ended in March 2009 with a strategic level architecture design document (pdf) for the proposed Interagency Fuels Treatment Decision Support System (IFTDSS). JFSP subsequently decided to fund the development of a proof of concept (POC) version of the IFTDSS to ensure technical feasibility and test early adoption by users. Sonoma Technology Inc. was awarded the contract for implementing Phase III. Tami Funk is the STI Project Manager and Mike Rauscher was retained as JFSP Project Manager.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Phase III consists of the following tasks:</p>
        <p>Task 1 - Project Planning: Task 1 involved scoping and planning for the IFTDSS software development effort. Planning activities included assembling the project team, scoping out and scheduling the work to be performed in Tasks 2 through 6, and preparing a project plan.</p>

        <p>Task 2 - Confirm the Functionality of the Proposed IFTDSS POC and Continued Engagement with the POC User Test Group: Task 2 involved confirming the proposed functionality of the IFTDSS POC and the workflow scenarios that it will address with field practitioners. This involved assembling a group of fuels treatment specialists and soliciting their review and input on the use cases and the functionality proposed for the POC. Based on feedback provided, we refined the conceptual design of the POC and prepared a report discussing the revised proposed POC specifications, workflow scenarios, and specific questions/functions that the system will address.</p>

        <p>Task 3 - Develop the user interface design, and web-based graphical user interface mock-ups and the IFTDSS POC design specification: Prior to implementing the IFTDSS POC, a software system design specification document was developed. The design specification document is based on the strategic architecture design produced in Phase II of the STS Study. The IFTDSS POC design specification includes detailed technical specifications that will be followed during implementation, including the back-end system design and the graphical user interface design. The graphical user interface will be designed and developed in parallel with the IFTDSS POC system. As web-based user interface mock-ups are developed, they are shared with the user community for review and feedback in parallel with the development of the IFTDSS back-end system. The web-based GUI will serve as a development platform and as a mechanism to engage the user community early.</p>

        <p>Task 4 - Implementation of the IFTDSS POC: Upon acceptance of the design specification document (Task 3), STI will implement the IFTDSS POC. We propose to use a phased, rapid-POC approach during application development. Conceptually, rapid-prototyping involves dividing the system implementation into discrete elements so that individual processes and/or modules can be developed, rapidly tested, and refined during the implementation process. When a process or module is acceptably functional, it can then be connected to its neighboring processes. The benefit of rapid-prototyping is that individual system components can be made accessible and tested during early development to ensure that the components are functioning properly from technical and user perspectives. At the onset of implementation, a small group of fuels treatment specialists will be identified and asked to periodically review system components throughout the implementation phase.</p>

        <p>Task 5 - Testing and Quality Assurance of the IFTDSS POC: Upon completion of the IFTDSS POC development, STI perform in-house unit and system quality assurance and software testing. Following the in-house testing, STI will make the system available via the Internet to a group of fuels treatment specialists who will test and provide feedback on system performance and/or possible refinements to the system.</p>

        <p>Task 7 - User Community Development: It is axiomatic that a large, multi-faceted software product such as the IFTDSS can only be used effectively if a well organized community of interested stakeholders exists. During Phase II of the STS Study, five stakeholder groups were identified: 1) the Governance community, 2) the Developer/Database community, 3) the Field User community, 4) the IT and System Maintenance community, and 5) the System Transition community. During Phase III, we will further define the five communities of stakeholders, describe the roles that members of each community should play, and form a core group of stakeholder participants that will actually perform these roles as they interact with developing the IFTDSS POC system.</p>
