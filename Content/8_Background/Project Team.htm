        <h4>Acknowledgements</h4>
        <p>Many individuals have contributed to the IFTDSS software development effort. We greatly appreciate the support and guidance provided by John Cissel, the JFSP program manager. Erik Christiansen, former Chair of the Fuels Management Committee (FMC), provided key help and support for analyzing the fuels treatment process that is a struggle for specialists from all agencies. The members of the former JFSP Fuels Treatment Working Group (FTWG) - Michael Beasely, Dennis Dupuis, Mark Finney, Glen Gibson, Randi Jandt, David Peterson, Tessa Nicolet, and Brad Reed - guided our work and provided initial critique and innovative ideas for the project. The members of the former JFSP Software Tools and Systems Study Advisory Committee - Pat Andrews, Nate Benson, Mike Hilbruner, Mike Hutt, David Peterson, Carol Saras, Paul Schlobohm, Shari Shetler, and Tim Swedberg - kept the study headed in the right direction and made sure that all of the various components of a successful solution were considered.</p>

                <p>We would like to specifically acknowledge the fuels treatment specialists who have agreed to participate in this effort to serve as the IFTDSS proof of concept (POC) Test User Group - Brad Reed, Brenda Wilmore, Eric Miller, Gary Curcio, Gary Fildes, Gwen Lipp, Jim Roessler, Jon Wallace, Jonathan Olsen, Karen Folger, Mack McFarland, Nikia Hernandez, Perry Grissom, Randi Jandt, Randy Stiplin, Scott Weyenberg, Sean McEldery, Tessa Nicolet, Alison Forrestel, Brian Sorbel, Daniel Rasmussen, Dennis Fiore, Dennis Page, Glenn Gibson, Jeremy Spetter, Joshua Keown, Kim Kelly, Kyle Jacobson, Loretta Duke, Mike Uebel, Sam Amato, Anna Payne, Dave Pergolski, Jennifer Croft, Jeremy Bennet, John Washington, Ken Rodgers, Mathew Weldon, Paul Maday, Rance Marquez, Albert Savage, William Aney, Yanu Gallimore, Lauren Miller, Kristen Allison - who have provided, and will continue to provide, valuable feedback regarding the functionality and usability of the IFTDSS. We also thank the broader group of 49 field fuels treatment specialists who helped develop and refine the fuels treatment decision support process.</p>
                <p>We would like to acknowledge our appreciation of the fire and fuels science and software development community - Eric Twombly, Mark Finney, Joe Scott, Alan Ager, Nick Crookston, Larry Gangi, Woodham Chung, Kurt Kruger - for their cooperation and feedback related to integrating data and software applications that will be a part of the IFTDSS. Thank you also to the <a href="http://www.fs.fed.us/pnw/fera/">FERA</a> team of Dave Peterson, Roger Ottmar, Susan Prichard, Paige Eagle, and Kjell Swedin for their support and assistance implementing new software modules into the IFTDSS. We would also like to acknowledge the managers of the <a href="http://wfdss.usgs.gov/wfdss/WFDSS_Home.shtml">WFDSS</a> project - Tom Zimmerman, Rob Seli, Mitch Burgard and their development team - and the BlueSky Framework - Sim Larkin - for their willingness to work collaboratively to develop software systems that can communicate with one another to create efficiencies in the fire and fuels domain.</p>
                <p>We would also like to thank the IT specialists who helped ensure that we have considered agency IT requirements - Brad Harwood, Laura Hill, John Gebhardt, and John Noneman. All of these groups constitute the stakeholders whose jobs will be positively affected by the results of this project. It will take long-term attention and energy from these groups of stakeholders, and from others yet to be engaged, to create an effective community of interest that will ensure that the IFTDSS helps all of us do our jobs better.</p>
