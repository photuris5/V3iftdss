        <h1>Using Masks for Editing and Modeling</h1>
        <p>In <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> shapefiles can be used to select specific areas for editing, or running models. This can be particularly helpful in working with treatment areas, units, etc. To use this feature you must first have a shapefile available for your project area. For information on creating or uploading shapefiles see the <a href="../MapStudio/Files/ShapefileInfo.htm" target="_blank">About Shapefiles Topic</a>.<img src="../Resources/Images/mapstudio/masks.png" alt="A valley with three polygons in which treatments are indicated with differing colors" style="width: 341px;height: 280px;float: right;" /></p>
        <p>Masks can be used in  <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> to define an area of interest when generating a landscape summary, or applied during the Edit Landscape task to apply rules only to a specific part of your landscape. </p>
        <p>In the Landscape Comparison task, you may use masks during the editing process to represent fuel treatments, then compare the results. An example of this is can be worked through by following the <a href="../Tutorials/CompareFeature/0_Intro.htm">Comparing Treatment Alternatives Tutorial</a>.</p>
        <p>Masks are not currently supported for individual landscape fire behavior runs. </p>
