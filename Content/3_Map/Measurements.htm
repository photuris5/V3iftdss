        <h1>Measurements</h1>
        <p>When using a map, you can measure the area of a polygon, the length of a line, or find the coordinates of a point. <MadCap:variable name="General.MapStudio" /> calculates the shortest distance (using the ellipsoid-based geodesic calculation) even if the data uses a projected coordinate system.
</p>
        <h2>
Make a measurement</h2>
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
            <li>
Click <span class="UIcomponent">Measure <img src="../Resources/Images/mapstudio/button_measurement.png" alt="measure"></img></span> to display the measure dialog box, your results appear within this box.</li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
            <li>To measure an area on the map, click Area <img src="../Resources/Images/mapstudio/button_esriArea.png" alt="area" /> and click the map once for every vertex of the area you want to measure. Double-click to complete the area.</li>
            <li>To measure a line on the map, click Distance <img src="../Resources/Images/mapstudio/button_esriDist.png" alt="distance" /> and click the map once for every vertex of the line you want to measure. Double-click to complete the area.</li>
            <li>To get coordinates for a point on the map, click Location <img src="../Resources/Images/mapstudio/button_esriLocation.png" alt="location" /> and click the map at the location for which you want to get coordinates.
</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Change the units</h2>
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
            <li>
Open the map in the map viewer.</li>
            <li>In <MadCap:variable name="General.MapStudio" />, click <span class="UIcomponent">Measure <img src="../Resources/Images/mapstudio/button_measurement.png"></img></span> to display the Measure dialog box.</li>
            <li>Choose the unit of measurement from the drop-down list. If you change units after making a measurement, the current result will be converted to the newly selected unit.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Move the map while measuring
</h2>
        <p>You may find that what you want to measure is not completely contained within the current extent of the map; for example, a road or parcel may extend beyond what is visible. In order to move the map as you're measuring, while still maintaining the cumulative total distance or area, you can hold down the left mouse button (or the equivalent navigation) and pan the map in the direction you want. Resume measuring by clicking the map with the left mouse button.</p>
