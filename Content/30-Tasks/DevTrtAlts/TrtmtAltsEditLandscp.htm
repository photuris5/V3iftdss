        <h1>Editing a Landscape to Develop Treatment Alternatives</h1>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../Resources/Snippets/EditLandscapeRules/EditingIntroAll_p1.flsnp" />
        <p>In Developing Treatment Alternatives, your <a href="../../00-Concepts/AboutLandscapesinIFTDSS.htm#Originating_Landscape_(Zero_“0”_landscape)" target="_blank">Originating Landscape</a> must be an <a href="../../00-Concepts/AboutLandscapesinIFTDSS.htm#Extracted_Unedited_Landscape" target="_blank">Extracted, unedited LANDFIRE</a> landscape and the only landscapes available for you to edit must fall within the same landscape extent. </p>
        <h2>Getting Ready to Edit</h2>
        <p><span class="UIcomponent">Edit Landscape</span> will walk you through editing your landscape based on a default set of rules you select, or a custom set of rules you create. </p>
        <p>Here you will edit landscapes to either develop your Existing Condition (EC) if needed, create your treatment alternatives, or make adjustments to previously created landscapes that match the extent of your Originating Landscape. </p>
        <p>Whatever the case might be, it is very important to have an Existing Condition to ensure more accurate comparison results to gauge how each alternative does or does not meet objectives. The Existing Condition may need to reflect new disturbances on your landscape, like recent wildfires, fuels treatments, or windfalls.</p>
        <p>Below is an image of the editing interface. View a map of your area while editing by clicking the globe icon <img src="../../Resources/Images/ButtonsGeneral/button_showsplitmap.png" alt="split map" /> at the top left of the page. Rules you select will display at the top of the interface, in the order you select them.</p>
