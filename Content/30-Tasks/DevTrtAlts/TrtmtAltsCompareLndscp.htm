        <p>Developing Treatment Alternatives facilitates evaluation of fuel treatment alternatives and their spatial arrangement on the landscape. It allows you to create several edited versions of a landscape or treatment area, run a fire behavior simulation for some or all of the edited landscapes, and compare the results for each treatment on fire behavior spatially, and create reports with charts and tables if desired. The task is divided into the steps below:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>The "Originating Landscape"&#160;is your unedited Landfire download. Any landscapes that match its extent will be available in the remaining steps, including the editing step. </li>
                    <li>The "Existing Landscape"&#160;refers to the landscape that most closely resembles the existing condition of your analysis area. This could be your Originating Landscape (if no Landfire edits are needed), it could be a previously edited landscape that matches the Originating Landscape's extent, or it could be a landscape you create by making edits in the next step of the comparison. </li>
                </ul>

                <p>If you have edited versions of your Originating Landscape that were created elsewhere in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName"></MadCap:variable>, they will be available in subsequent steps. However, if you need to create these, or make alternate versions, you may do so in this editing step.</p>
                <p>There are two methods for making edits to your landscape, <span class="UIcomponent">Add Default Fuels Treatment/Disturbance Edit Rule</span>, <a href="../LndscpEdit/TreatmentRuleBackground.htm" target="_blank">which relies upon the Landfire Lookup rules for various fuels treatments and times since disturbance.</a> Alternatively, use <span class="UIcomponent">User Created Edit Rules</span> to create your own editing rules.</p>

                <p>Use this tab to establish the model state by which all landscapes in your comparison session  will be run and compared.  If you are unsure as to what your model state should be for your comparison session, utilize <span class="UIcomponent">My Modeling Playground</span> to test different weather and fuel moisture conditions on your landscape(s).  Creating an <a href="../Summaries/Auto97Summary.htm" target="_blank">Auto97th Landscape Fire Behavior report</a> in the <span class="UIcomponent">Landscape Summary</span> task of the <span class="UIcomponent">Landscape Evaluation </span>stage of the planning cycle. can also help give you a starting point for establishing model inputs.</p>
                <p>Populate these inputs as you would any other fire behavior run:</p>
                <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">

                    <li>The <span class="UIcomponent">+ add row</span> option under the "Initial Fuel Moisture" section, allows you to add rows and specify different fuel moistures for the different fuel models contained in your landscape. Leaving this option blank will apply the same for all fuel models across the landscape.</li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Click <span class="UIcomponent">Save Inputs</span> at the bottom of the screen and move to the <span class="UIcomponent">Run Model</span> tab.</p>

                <p>The <span class="UIcomponent">Run Model</span> tab provides a space where you can re-name and run models for landscapes you created in the <span class="UIcomponent">Edit Landscape</span> tab.  The Landscape column in the Run Model table will list landscape “0” as selected in the <span class="UIcomponent">Pick Landscape</span> tab and all of its derivatives.  Again, as mentioned in previous tabs, landscapes edited off of landscape “0” outside of this workflow will be available here as well.  You can model and compare those landscapes just the same as if you created them within this session.  The Run Name box will be auto populated with the landscape name and the type of model being run. </p>

                <p>To begin,  select a treatment or disturbance landscape, which will be tagged with a "1". Next, select your Existing Landscape (The landscape prior to your disturbance or treatment) our existing landscape, which will be tagged with a "2". The comparison displays the difference in landscape features and fire behavior between the two landscapes. </p>

                <div class="notificationNote">
                    <p>Why 2-1? The use of "1" and "2" in the comparison tool is product of how <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName"></MadCap:variable> calculates the comparison. For example, if we are interested in the change in flame length between a Treatment and the Existing landscape, we'd select the Treatment first (it gets assigned "1") and the Existing condition landscape second (it gets assigned "2"). <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName"></MadCap:variable> calculates landscape change as:</p>
                    <p>1-2=landscape change</p>
                    <p>For example, if flame lengths in the treated area are 3 feet (landscape “1”) , and flame lengths in the untreated area are 8 feet (landscape “2”), the resulting comparison landscape will show a value of -5, or a reduction in flame length of 5 feet:</p>
                    <p>3ft-8ft = -5 ft.</p>
                </div>
                <h3>Comparing  on Map</h3>
                <p>With your two landscapes selected, click <span class="UIcomponent">View in Map</span>.The left side of the screen will split out to show the map interface. </p>
                <p>You will notice the map contains landscape and model output layers for both the EC and prescribed fire treated landscapes, as well as a layer for model outputs and landscape features indicating the degree of change between each. Specifically, the map will have:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Modeled Output Change:&#160;Treated/Existing</li>
                    <li>Modeled Output: Treated</li>
                    <li>Model Output:&#160;Existing</li>
                    <li>Landscape Change:&#160;Treated/Existing</li>
                    <li>Landscape: Treated</li>
                    <li>Landscape:&#160;Existing</li>

                </p>
                <p>In the pictured example above, we can see flame length and rate of spread both decreased substantially in the treatment areas, and crown fire activity also decreased.</p>
                <p>You can use the <span class="UIcomponent">Swipe</span> widget, to swipe back and forth between layers, as pictured below. For example, you may turn off all layers except the two model outputs for a treated and existing landscape and swipe between the two to note the differences. Select the <span class="UIcomponent">Swipe</span> <img src="../../Resources/Images/MapStudio/overview/button_slider.png" alt="swipe tool button" /> widget in the top right of the map interface. If you are unfamiliar with Swipe, <a href="../../10-MapStudio/Functions/Swipe.htm" target="_blank">view the swipe widget topic here</a>. </p>

                <p>With two landscapes selected you may also generate a fire behavior summary report, or landscape feature summary report, by the <span class="UIcomponent">Compare in Summary Report</span> button. Next to the Fire Behavior Compare Summary Report option, click <span class="UIcomponent">Create Report</span></p>
