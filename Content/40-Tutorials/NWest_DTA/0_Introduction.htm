        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>Annie is a Fuels Technician who needed to do a hazardous fuels reduction project on the Boise National Forest. Annie used <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> to save time in analysis by developing, modeling, comparing, and generating reports on hazardous fuels reduction treatments within a single interface. Below, she walks us step by step, through her treatment development process from start to finish. </p>
        <h2>Management Scenario</h2>
        <p>My name is Annie and I’m a Fuels Technician on the Idaho City Ranger District, Boise Nat’l Forest, about 30 miles northeast of Boise, Idaho. I’ve found <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> to be a useful tool in planning hazardous fuels reduction projects and want to share with you my process on one such project.</p>
        <p>Through observation and based on Forest Plan direction, I know we need some sort of fuels reduction treatment in the mixed conifer stands in Granite Creek drainage, approximately 4 miles east of Idaho City. The area hasn’t been treated in decades and the understory and surface fuels could contribute to uncharacteristically intense fire behavior. This would not only pose a hazard to the community of Idaho City and adjacent private land, but also cause undue mortality in this fire-adapted low elevation Ponderosa pine ecosystem that thrives on frequent but low severity fires.</p>
        <p>My objectives are to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li> Reduce surface fuel loading and the overall horizontal and vertical fuelbed continuity to reduce the fire hazard to adjacent private land and the community of Idaho City</li>
            <li>Return low intensity fire to fire adapted vegetation communities. </li>
            <li>Locate areas where our actions will be most effective</li>
            <li> Evaluate what type of treatment will help me achieve these objectives</li>
            <li>Demonstrate the need for treatment, both quantitatively and spatially, to members of our district interdisciplinary (ID) team. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>I turned to <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> for help with this.</p>

        <p>Previewing and Creating a Landscape Using <MadCap:variable name="General.MapStudio" /></p>
        <h2>Previewing the Area with <MadCap:variable name="General.MapStudio" /></h2>
        <p>My first stop was in <MadCap:variable name="General.MapStudio" /> so I could get a good look at the area I’m interested in, and create a landscape to start working off of.  I use the <span class="UIcomponent">+/-</span> buttons on the map to zoom in to the Granite Creek drainage. While doing so, I decide I’d rather use an imagery layer, so I use the <span class="UIcomponent">Basemap Gallery</span> button <img src="../../Resources/Images/mapstudio/button_basemapglry.png" alt="basemap gallery" /> at the bottom of the screen to change my basemap to "Imagery with Labels".</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/granite_crk_dta/map_studio_explore.png" alt="use map studio to explore your area" style="width: 833px; height: 527px;" class="border" />
        </p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
            <li>Access <MadCap:variable name="General.MapStudio" /> from the top navigation panel, visible on any page in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />.</li>
            <li>Use the <span class="UIcomponent">Zoom</span> buttons, your mouse, or the ESRI&#160;search box to find locations and explore your landscape.</li>
            <li>To change the basemap, use the <span class="UIcomponent">Basemap Gallery</span> button.</li>
            <li>Select a basemap for your viewing session, in this example, "Imagery with Labels".</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Create a Landscape</h2>
        <p>Next, I want to create my landscape, which will serve as a starting point for the rest of my analysis. To do this I:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/granite_crk_dta/obtain_landscape.png" alt="use the 'Landscape Tools' to add a new landscape" style="width: 748px;height: 435px;" class="border" />
        </p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
            <li> Click on the <span class="UIcomponent">Landscape Tools</span> button at the bottom of the screen.</li>
            <li>Select the <span class="UIcomponent">Create New</span> tab, to create a new landscape.</li>
            <li> Select <span class="UIcomponent">Draw Mode</span>, then drag across the area I’d like to analyze.  Alternatively, you can follow along by inputting the coordinates below directly:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>East: -115.5848</li>
                <li>West: -115.8096</li>
                <li>North: 43.8854</li>
                <li>South: 43.7675</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Select the version of LANDFIRE&#160;data I&#160;wanted, in this case 2012.</li>
            <li>Select the fire behavior fuel model type (13 or 40), here I&#160;have chosen Fuel Model 40.</li>
            <li>Name my new landscape "Granite Creek LF2012 unedited." I included the name, Landfire version, and its editing/treatment status will make it easier to discern this landscape from others once we start editing.</li>
            <li>Choose or create a new folder for this landscape. This is the folder the landscape will be stored in on My Workspace. Here I&#160;have created a "Granite Creek Treatments" folder</li>
            <li>Once everything looks good, I click on the <span class="UIcomponent">Create</span> button and wait a minute for my landscape to process.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Summarizing my Landscape</h2>
        <p>Next, I’d like to take a look at my newly created landscape on the map and get an idea of fire behavior. This can be done by creating a summary report and viewing the results in <MadCap:variable name="General.MapStudio" />:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/granite_crk_dta/summary.png" alt="landscape summary will summarize features and auto97th fire behavior" style="width: 782px; height: 450px;" class="border" />
        </p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
            <li> I  click on <span class="UIcomponent">Planning Cycle</span> in the top navigation.</li>
            <li>The cycle opens on the <span class="UIcomponent">Landscape Evaluation</span> stage by default, where I click the <span class="UIcomponent">Landscape Summary</span> task.</li>
            <li>In <span class="UIcomponent">Landscape Summary</span>, I click the dropdown box next to <span class="UIcomponent">My Landscapes</span>. My newly created landscape doesn’t appear in the drop down, so I type it in the blank box a the top of the list. My landscape appears with a green check next to it. From this same screen I can create an automated report to summarize not only the landscape characteristics, but the modeled fire behavior outputs specific to this landscape based on approximated worst case (97th percentile fuel moisture and wind) conditions.</li>
            <li>I click on <span class="UIcomponent">Request a Report</span> so my report can begin processing, it’ll take a few minutes. In the meantime, I close the Report dialogue box, then click on View in Map Studio so I can look at the map version of my landscape characteristics. Since I just clicked on Request a Report, 97th percentile modeled fire behavior will be available in Map Studio as well now.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Assessing the map and the report will allow me to learn more about the fuel characteristics and expected fire behavior on my landscape, thus informing where I may place fuels treatments, as well as what kinds of treatments I may need to achieve my objectives. Later, I can use <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> to compare expected fire behavior using various simulated treatments in my project area.</p>
        <h2>Assessing my Landscape</h2>
        <p>Next, I"ll assess my landscape using various tools in <MadCap:variable name="General.MapStudio" />:</p>
        <h3>Identify Tool</h3>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/granite_crk_dta/show_landscape.png" alt="Landscape Tools adds landscapes to map studio" style="width: 357px; height: 338px;" class="border" />
        </p>
        <p>Open <MadCap:variable name="General.MapStudio" /></p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
            <li>Use the <span class="UIcomponent">Landscape Tools</span> <img src="../../Resources/Images/mapstudio/button_landscapetools.png" alt="Landscape tools button" /> button to check your landscape under the "Add to Map" tab, to add it to Layer List and your map.</li>
            <div>
                <img src="../../Resources/Images/granite_crk_dta/layer_list_and_identify.png" alt="use the identify tool for more information" style="width: 602px; height: 361px;" class="border" />
            </div>
            <li>After opening the <span class="UIcomponent">Layer List</span> button <img src="../../Resources/Images/mapstudio/button_layerlist.png" alt="layer list button" />, I ensure my landscape is checked, then I can check and uncheck the landscape layers I’d like to view. I’d really like to look at the fuel models to make sure they correspond to what I’m seeing on the ground in this area, so I ensure that box is checked.</li>
            <li>I access more information for the landscape and subsequent layers via the small arrows next to the check boxes. In this case, I check the box next to "Fuel Models", then click on the arrow to access the Fuel Model layer legend.</li>
            <li>I click the <span class="UIcomponent">Identify</span> button <img src="../../Resources/Images/mapstudio/button_identify.png" alt="indentiry" /> in the upper right corner of the page to view more information for each pixel. I select the layer I’d like to view (current landscape), then click on the landscape in an area I’d like to know more about. The "Identify information box" populates with the landscape information for this pixel. For example, I now know that the green-blue pixels on the map correspond to areas of Fuel Model 188 (TL8). I continue checking out various areas of interest on my landscape to learn more about what fuel models are present and where. Notice that all of the landscape characteristics come up in the Identify box when you click on the landscape with the <img src="../../Resources/Images/mapstudio/button_identify.png" alt="indentiry" /> button, not just the characteristic you specified in your <span class="UIcomponent">Layer List</span>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/granite_crk_dta/transparency.png" alt="transparency can be set using the more options icon to the right of each layer" style="width: 332px; height: 428px;" class="border" />
        </p>
        <p>I’d like to see more of the features on the map, such as roads, and my landscape characteristics at the same time, so I click the 3 dots to the right of my Landscape name in <span class="UIcomponent">Layer List</span>. A dropdown box of options opens. I choose <span class="UIcomponent">Transparency</span>, which opens a slider bar allowing me to choose what level of transparency I’d like to see on my map.</p>
        <h3>Add reference data</h3>
        <p>Before I do a full assessment of the landscape characteristics, I’d like to view previous fires that may have occurred in this area. Fortunately, this is easy to do:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/granite_crk_dta/add_reference_data.png" alt="use 'add reference data' to add historic disturbance information" style="width: 712px; height: 413px;" class="border" />
        </p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
            <li>Using <span class="UIcomponent">Add Reference Data</span> button <img src="../../Resources/Images/mapstudio/button_adref.png" alt="add reference data" /> at the bottom of the screen, I see there are many options for additional data layers, including "Ownership" and "Critical Habitat Areas". </li>
            <li>For now, I’m only interested in "Disturbance History" – both "Historic Fuel Treatment Polygons", as well as "Historic Wildfire Perimeters". I select both, and the years I’m interested in, so they’ll show up in my <span class="UIcomponent">Layer List</span> and on my map.</li>
            <li>I use the <span class="UIcomponent">Identify </span>tool to identify the exact year of the Rabbit Creek and Bannock fires. Then I click the applicable Fire Perimeter layers on and off so I can assess the landscape and fuel models underneath to ensure they’re reflective of these fires.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>I follow this same process with the Historic Fuel Treatment Polygons layer as well.</p>
        <p>After doing an assessment of all the landscape characteristics (Elevation, Slope, Aspect, Canopy Cover, Stand Height, Canopy Base Height and Canopy Bulk Density) I determine that the Landfire 2012 data, which was used to develop this landscape, is reflective of existing conditions, including previous fires. If there had been a more recent disturbance (since this Landfire layer was produced in 2012), such as a fire or fuels treatment I wanted to mimic on this landscape, I could easily create a polygon to reflect this area of interest, then make the appropriate landscape edits to reflect the disturbance on the landscape (More information on Landscape Editing is available via the <a href="../../30-Tasks/LndscpEdit/LandscapeEditAbout.htm" target="_blank">Landscape Editing Topic</a>.</p>
        <h3>Comparing Landscape Features and Model Outputs with the Swipe Tool</h3>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/granite_crk_dta/auto97_flame_length.png" alt="use 'simulation output tools' to add the auto97th model outputs" style="width: 742px; height: 452px;" class="border" />
        </p>
        <p>Now that I have a good idea of the specific characteristics of my landscape, I want to look at the expected fire behavior using 97th percentile weather and fuel moisture conditions. We ran the summary earlier, and have to add it to the map to do this I:</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
            <li>Click the <span class="UIcomponent">Simulation Output Tools</span> button <img src="../../Resources/Images/mapstudio/button_SimOutput.png" alt="simulation output tools" /> on the bottom of the screen.</li>
            <li>Check the box next to “Granite Creek LF2012 unedited-Auto97th” to add the fire behavior layer to <span class="UIcomponent">Layer List</span> and my map. I check the appropriate boxes in the Layer List dialogue box so I can view Flame Lengths and the corresponding legend.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>I zoom into an orange/red area where I can see concentrated areas of expected high Flame Lengths. I want to know what the topography and fuel models are where I’m seeing the more intense fire behavior.</p>
        <p>I set up my Layer List to have the Fuel Model checked for the Granite Creek Landscape layer, as well as Flame Lengths for the Auto97th modeled fire behavior output. I can quickly switch between layers to view changes by checking/unchecking the layers, or by using the <span class="UIcomponent">Swipe Tool</span><img src="../../Resources/Images/mapstudio/button_slider.png" alt="swipe tool" />.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/granite_crk_dta/swipe_pretreatment.png" alt="using the swipe tool in the top right can help evaluate our landscape" style="width: 765px; height: 400px;" class="border" />
        </p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
            <li>I click the <span class="UIcomponent">Swipe Tool</span><img src="../../Resources/Images/mapstudio/button_slider.png" alt="swipe tool" />.</li>
            <li>Next, I&#160;specify the layers I&#160;want to swipe - the first layer I select will be the layer I view on the top of the slider bar, the second layer checked in <span class="UIcomponent">Layer List</span> will be the layer on the bottom of the slider bar. In this case, Granite Creek LF2012 unedited – Auto97th layer. I slide the bar in the middle of the screen up and down and I can see that the areas with high flame lengths correspond to areas of Fuel Model 188 (TL8) with some small patches 165 (TU5), which is what I suspected.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/granite_crk_dta/swipe_pretreatment2.png" alt="swipe tool showing topography below the layer" style="width: 604px; height: 298px;" class="border" />
        </p>
        <p>Additionally, I want to view the topography layer underneath to see if there is a theme in the areas displaying more intense fire behavior. I uncheck the boxes in the <span class="UIcomponent">Layer List</span> then re-click the Granite Creek LF2012 unedited – Auto97th.This will display only the behavior layer, and allow us to see the topography underneath. If this does not occur on your map, try selecting the Model Output: Granite Creek by clicking on it from the Swipe dialog that appears in the top right. </p>
        <p>As I swipe up and down I can see that the areas displaying the more intense fire behavior are all west or northwest facing slopes. I complete further analysis by repeating this process in the northern part of my landscape where there appears to be several areas that would produce more intense fire behavior. I also compare other aspects of fire behavior, such as Rate of Spread and Crown Fire Activity.</p>
        <p>With this information, I decide to create two separate Areas of Interest, or areas on which I’d like to focus my analysis and treatments.</p>
        <h2>Creating Areas of Interest</h2>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/granite_crk_dta/create_aoi_1.png" alt="set the layer list to view flame length" style="width: 578px; height: 378px;" class="border" />
        </p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
            <li>To create an Area of Interest, or polygon, I change the <span class="UIcomponent">Basemap Gallery</span> layer to “Imagery with Labels” so I can see landscape imagery.</li>
            <li> Then I set up my <span class="UIcomponent">Layer List </span>to show my 97th percentile fire behavior output layer for Flame Lengths, and set the transparency so I can see roads and topography as I create my Area of Interest, or treatment area.</li>
            <div>
                <img src="../../Resources/Images/granite_crk_dta/create_treatment_polys2.png" alt="use 'create/edit' shapes to create treatment polygons" style="width: 865px; height: 403px;" class="border" />
            </div>
            <li>I select the <span class="UIcomponent">Create/Edit Shapes</span> button <img src="../../Resources/Images/mapstudio/button_editTools.png" alt="create or edit shapes" /> at the bottom of the screen and ensure <span class="UIcomponent">Polygons</span> is selected in the dropdown box in <span class="UIcomponent">Create/Edit Shapes</span>. </li>
            <li>Then I select <span class="UIcomponent">Freehand Polygon</span> button <img src="../../Resources/Images/mapstudio/button_edittools_freehand.png" alt="freehand draw button" /> , draw a shape around one of my areas, then select the button again and draw a shape around the second area. I’ve selected two areas in my landscape that exhibited high modeled fire intensity. I’d like to concentrate on these areas as far as comparing treatments that may help me meet my preliminary objectives of reducing the fire hazard in this area, as well as returning low intensity fire to this landscape.</li>
            <li>To save these two treatments as one set of shapefiles, I click the <span class="UIcomponent">Copy from Existing Features</span> button <img src="../../Resources/Images/mapstudio/button_copy_exstng_ftrs.png" alt="copy from exisitng features button" style="width: 23px;height: 23px;" />, check the <span class="UIcomponent">Select multipart</span> button option, single left-click one shape, then single left click the other shape, then proceed to naming.</li>
            <li>After drawing my shapes, I name this Area of Interest “Granite Creek Proposed Treatment Areas”, then I save this new shape to my existing "Granite Creek Treatments" folder. This will ensure this Area of Interest is filed in the same location in <span class="UIcomponent">My Workspace</span> as all my other Granite Creek project files.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Reviewing a Landscape Summary Report</h2>
        <p>Now that I’ve thoroughly reviewed my landscape and modeled fire behavior on the map, as well as identified the areas on which I’d like to focus treatments, I want to take a look at the corresponding landscape and fire behavior summary reports. </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/granite_crk_dta/view_summary.png" alt="click the 'view summary' button to review reports" style="width: 630px; height: 203px;" class="border" />
        </p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
            <li>I navigate away from Map Studio and click on <span class="UIcomponent">My Workspace</span> at the top of the screen,</li>
            <li>select my "Granite Creek Treatments Folder" in the left hand panel. As I&#160;navigate  I notice  the information in the Right Hand Panel changes as well. It appears to update as I move through different screens. </li>
            <li>select the "Granite Creek LF2012 unedited - Auto97th" report file and click the <span class="UIcomponent">View Summary</span> button.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The Landscape, as well as the Model Output and the Summary Reports, are all contained in my Granite Creek Fuels folder.</p>
        <p>I want to view the reports, so I click on the top file.</p>
        <p>The option to <span class="UIcomponent">View Summary</span> appears, so I click on that and take a look at my reports.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/granite_crk_dta/report_fuel_model.png" alt="summary reports generate a variety of outputs, table, pie charts, bar charts." style="width: 561px; height: 388px;" class="border" />
        </p>
        <p>All of the Landscape characteristics, as well as Fire Behavior outputs, I’ve just viewed in Map Studio are quantitatively displayed in several different formats in this report. I find a lot of value in these reports because they break each component (Canopy Cover, Canopy Base Height, Rate of Spread, etc.) down in a way that makes it even easier, after viewing the spatial data, to assess the landscape and 97th percentile modeled fire behavior. For example, in viewing the Fuel Model map (upper left corner), I can see that I have a lot of Fuel Model TL8 on my landscape, but it’s not until I take a look at the graphs that I can really assess that, in fact, 35% of this landscape is attributed to the TL8 fuel model.</p>
        <p>I take a good look at the report in it’s entirety, including the Flame length outputs:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/granite_crk_dta/report_flame_length.png" alt="reports include flame length and other fire behavior measurements" style="width: 593px; height: 418px;" class="border" />
        </p>
        <p>These graphs indicate that, given 97th percentile weather and fuel moisture conditions, a little over half of this landscape will experience Flame Lengths of &gt;0 - .3 meters, while another 1/3rd will experience Flame Lengths &gt;.3 - 1.2 meters. I plan to focus my treatments in the specific areas on this landscape where I’m noticing more intense, “problem” fire behavior, from both an ecological and a control perspective.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/granite_crk_dta/report_flamelength_map.png" alt="details are displayed on the bottom right of the report maps" style="width: 704px; height: 746px;" class="border" />
        </p>
        <p>I notice the Auto97th Fire Behavior section of the report has recorded the 97th percentile weather and fuel moisture inputs used to run the fire behavior model. I want to use these values when I run the fire behavior model a little later, so I scroll up to the top of the report, look to the top right, and click the Download button to save this report as a pdf on my local machine.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/granite_crk_dta/report_save.png" alt="the 'save as pdf' button is located in the top right of the report" style="width: 236px; height: 177px;" class="border" />
        </p>
        <p>Next its time to develop some treatment alternatives.</p>
        <h2>Developing Treatment Alternatives</h2>
        <p>Now that I have my baseline Landscape and Fire Behavior data, and some specific areas within my landscape for which I’d like to propose treatments to meet my preliminary objectives, I’ll move on to the Develop Treatment Alternatives workflow, under the <span class="UIcomponent">Strategic Planning</span> stage of the Cycle. This will allow me to develop and compare fuels treatment alternatives so I can determine how changes in the fuels characteristics affect fire behavior outputs.</p>
        <p>I select the <span class="UIcomponent">Develop Treatment Alternatives</span> task.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/granite_crk_dta/DTA_Task.png" alt="select the 'develop treatment alternatives' task from the 'strategic planning' stage of the planning cycle" style="width: 759px; height: 329px;" class="border" />
        </p>
        <p>The next screen brings up the 5 steps in the Develop Treatment Alternatives task.</p>
        <h3>Pick a landscape and area of interest</h3>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/granite_crk_dta/dta_pick_landscape.png" style="width: 700px; height: 284px;" class="border" />
        </p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
            <li>First, I select my Originating Landscape and the </li>
            <li>Area of Interest created earlier in <MadCap:variable name="General.MapStudio" />.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>I notice the Right Hand Panel has some good information regarding how to use my landscapes correctly in this task. I make it a point to read through these panels for each page, they seem to contain really helpful information.</p>
        <h3>Edit the landscape to simulate treatment scenarios</h3>
        <p>Next, I move to the <span class="UIcomponent">Edit Landscape</span> tab, where I'll select a Default Fuels Treatment rule, and apply it to the landscape to simulate a thin and pile burn. Then I can see what effect the proposed treatment has on my Area of Interest. To do this I:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/granite_crk_dta/dta_edit_0_lcp.png" alt="using the default edit rules is a quick way to simulate treatments on the landscape" style="width: 606px; height: 376px;" class="border" />
        </p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
            <li>Double check that Granite Creek LF2012 unedited landscape is selected</li>
            <li>Select the "Thin: Slash Removed default" rule</li>
            <li>Choose the "Light Thinning:&#160;Pile Burning" option</li>
            <li>Select 1 year since disturbance</li>
            <li>Select the "Granite&#160;Creek Proposed Treatment Areas" mask to apply the rule to</li>
            <li>Click the <span class="UIcomponent">Add to Rules</span> button</li>
        </ol>
        <p>This rule will mimic thinning my Area of Interest to about 80% present density by removing understory up to 8” DBH, with subsequent pile burning of thinned material. This information appears if I&#160;hover over the "Light Thinning: Pile Burning" option described in step C above. Alternatively the description of each default rule can be read in the <a href="../../30-Tasks/LndscpEdit/TreatmentRuleBackground.htm" target="_blank">Landscape Editing - Default Fuel Treatment and Disturbance Topic</a> of Help Center.</p>
        <p>I’d also like to mimic a broadcast burn after these first entries, but will need to apply that edit in a subsequent edit session. I read in the <a href="../../30-Tasks/LndscpEdit/RuleOrdering.htm" target="_blank">Rule Ordering Consideration help topic</a> that it is  best to apply these Default Edits one at a time, then build on each edit if you’d like. It’s always a good idea to assess your landscape after each edit to ensure it’s been applied correctly and makes sense.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/granite_crk_dta/dta_edit_rule_save.png" alt="you will recieve a message confirming your edit rule has been saved" style="width: 654px; height: 275px;" class="border" />
        </p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
            <li>After I&#160;clicked the <span class="UIcomponent"> Add to Rules</span> button, A notification appeared to confirm my rule had been added. </li>
            <li>Since I&#160;am just implementing this one rule for now, I&#160;scroll to the bottom of the screen, name my landscape so its easy to see what treatments it represents (Granite Creek LF2012 Light Thin Pile Rx 1yr Post Prop Trt Areas), and click <span class="UIcomponent">Save New Landscape</span>. </li>
            <li>Once the new landscape is saved, a notification will appear at the top of the screen that lets me know it has been successfully submitted. </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Enter parameters for a fire behavior modeling scenario</h3>
        <p>In the <span class="UIcomponent">Modeling Input</span> tab I want to use 97th percentile weather and fuel moisture inputs when running the fire behavior model. I open my pdf copy of the report and  use the inputs from the Auto97th report I ran earlier. I can also obtain this information again anytime by accessing my Auto97th report in <span class="UIcomponent">My Workspace</span>, but with a pdf, I don't have to navigate back and forth through <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/granite_crk_dta/dta_model_inputs.png" alt="enter the modeling parameters under the Model Input tab" style="width: 587px; height: 401px;" class="border" />
        </p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
            <li>I enter the inputs for wind, crown fire inputs, and initial fuel moisture</li>
            <li>By not clicking + add row, I am keeping the Initial fuel moistures the same for all fuel models. If I  select “add row”, I could enter specific fuel models and assign unique moisture conditions for each one. </li>
            <li>I click <span class="UIcomponent">Save Inputs</span> at the bottom of the screen and move to the Run Model tab.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Running Fire Behavior</h3>
        <p>I want to run the fire behavior model on both of these landscapes here so I can compare the results. Here, I:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/granite_crk_dta/dta_run_model.png" alt="click 'run model' next to each landscape you wish to model" class="border" style="width: 608px;height: 167px;" />
        </p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
            <li> Check the names next to each of my landscape, if I&#160;wanted, I&#160;could rename them here</li>
            <li>Click Run Model next to each landscape I&#160;want to run</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Next I&#160;move to the <span class="UIcomponent">Compare Alternatives</span> tab.</p>
        <h3>Compare Alternatives</h3>
        <p>Once on the <span class="UIcomponent">Compare Alternatives</span> tab, I select each landscape I want to compare. They will be numbered in the order I select them, and from reading the Right Hand Panel information, I see that this order is very important:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/granite_crk_dta/dta_compare_1.png" alt="use the 'compare on map' and 'compare in summary report button' to compare results" style="width: 705px;height: 205px;" />
        </p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
            <li>First, I select the edited landscape so it has a "1" next to it. Then, I&#160;select the current landscape, so it has a “2” next to it. This order tells <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> to calculate the difference created by our treated landscape (1) on our original landscape (2). For example, if our new landscape has flame lengths of 3 feet, and the original has flame lengths of 7 feet, the difference will be: 3 - 7 = -4. Or in other words, a 4 foot <i>reduction</i> in flame length from the treatment.</li>
            <li>Now I click to view comparison outputs on the map and as a report. can view the effects of my selected fuels treatment on my Area of Interest in both a comparison report and on a map. First I click the <span class="UIcomponent">Compare in Summary Report</span> button so that can begin processing, next I&#160;click the <span class="UIcomponent">Compare on Map</span> button to view results on the map.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Comparing Alternatives </h2>
        <p>[slide 22]</p>
        <p>After clicking <span class="UIcomponent">Compare on Map</span>, my map appears in split screen mode. This feature allows me to view information from each tab on the right side of the screen, while allowing me to view my map on the left. I can open or close this feature anytime by selecting the opposing arrows icon at the top of the screen.</p>
        <p>Initially I see a simple landscape change map, indicating which pixels experienced a Fuel Model change post-treatment.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/granite_crk_dta/dta_compare_lcpchange.png" alt="the landscape change layer indicates pixels with a new fire behavior fuel model" style="width: 874px; height: 396px;" class="border" />
        </p>
        <p>I’d like to view the change in Flame Length after my treatment, so I open <span class="UIcomponent">Layer List</span> and check the box next to: "Model Output Change: Granite Creek LF2012 Light Thin Pile Rx 1yr Post Prop Trt Areas/Granite Creek lf2012 unedited". This layer shows the difference between post-treatment and pre-treatment Flame Lengths. With a glance I can see that all the dark blue showing on those West/Northwest facing slopes that had initially shown very high flame lengths, are now indicating significantly decreased flame lengths and fire intensity. </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/granite_crk_dta/dta_compare_flamelengths.png" alt="model change layer depicts changes in model results between the two landscapes" style="width: 923px;height: 417px;" class="border" />
        </p>
        <p>To get back to these maps later, I can either access them in our project folder in <span class="UIcomponent">My Workspace</span>, or select this landscape in the<span class="UIcomponent"> Develop Treatment Alternatives</span> task, and click through each tab to get back to this point. <span class="comment" MadCap:conditions="General.DeveloperNotes">[REPLACE IMAGES AFTER THIS POINT] </span></p>
        <p>To access the summary reports, I can either find them in our project folder in <span class="UIcomponent">My Workspace</span>, or click the button again and click on the links displayed in the pop-up box. In this case&#160;I'll go to <span class="UIcomponent">My Workspace</span>.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/granite_crk_dta/workspace report.png" alt="reports are stored in our project folder in My Workspace" />
        </p>
        <p>After opening my project folder, I navigate to the "Landscape Compare Report" and click the <span class="UIcomponent">View Summary</span> button.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/granite_crk_dta/dta_comparereport1_fuelmodel.png" alt="fuel models are compared via bar chart and table" />
        </p>
        <p>I review the pre- and post-treatment results for each landscape characteristic. These reports have the same quantitative components as the reports I viewed initially, but they compare the change in pixel value in my specified treatment area, or mask, before and after the treatment I selected was “applied”.</p>
        <p>In the bar graph, I can see that green corresponds to pre-treatment fuel models in the treatment area, while blue corresponds to post-treatment. It appears that most of the TL8 pixels were changed to TL6 post-treatment. Looking at the tabular data below, I can see that in fact, 47% of the treatment area was changed to Fuel Model TL6 with this treatment.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/granite_crk_dta/dta_comparereport1_fuelmodelcharts.png" alt="fuel models are compared via change chart and pie chart" />
        </p>
        <p>The Fuel Model Percent Difference graph and pie charts tell the same story. I’m really curious how this translates to expected post-treatment fire behavior. I know that the TL6 Fuel Model has a slightly lower Rate of Spread than the TL8 Fuel Model, but it’d be helpful to quantify and display this.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/granite_crk_dta/dta_comparereport1_flamelenths.png" alt="flame lengths compared via bar chart and table" style="width: 919px;height: 476px;" />
        </p>
        <p>Next, I go to <span class="UIcomponent">My Workspace</span> and navigate to my "Fire Behavior (Model) Compare Report", and click <span class="UIcomponent">View Report</span>.</p>
        <p>As in the landscape Compare Report, green correlates to pre-treatment, while blue indicates post-treatment results in the bar chart. I can see from this bar chart that the number of pixels in the lower Flame Length bins goes up post-treatment, while the number in the higher Flame Length bins goes down, indicating a decrease in higher Flame Length post-treatment. The table to the right quantitatively supports this, clearly showing the pixel count shifting toward the lower flame length bins, post-treatment.</p>

        </p>
        <p>The Percent Difference Graph for Flame Lengths demonstrates the shift toward lower Flame Lengths post-treatment. I can see the positive percent difference in the &gt;.3 m bin, while the bins correlating to higher Flame Lengths indicate a drop in the percent difference.</p>
        <p>The Pie Charts tell the same story, plainly showing the smaller sections of red/orange/yellow in the post-treatment chart.</p>
        <p>I scroll through the rest of the Fire Behavior Compare Summary Report to view the rest of fire behavior characteristics. <span class="comment" MadCap:conditions="General.DeveloperNotes">[END CANNED IMAGES]</span></p>
        <h2>Adding an Additional Treatment to Treatment Alternatives</h2>
        <p>I’d like to see the effects of applying a subsequent broadcast burn after the light thinning/pile burning. One of my objectives is to re-introduce low intensity fire in this area and I feel it’s an important step in treating this landscape. Additionally, I’d like to see how this additional treatment will affect modeled fire behavior. </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/granite_crk_dta/dta2_picklcp.png" alt="we have picked the same originating landscape and area of interest as before." style="width: 576px;height: 349px;" />

            <li>I select a treatment time of 1 Year.</li>
            <li>I'll apply this rule to our "Granite Creek Proposed Treatment Areas" mask.</li>
            <li>Then click <span class="UIcomponent">Add to Rules</span>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>As before I'll give the landscape a detailed name:&#160;"Granite Creek LF2012 Lt Thn Pl Rx 1yr LS WF 1yr" and click <span class="UIcomponent">Save New Landscape</span>.</p>

        <p>I can skip the Model Input tab this time, that input was saved from our last run. </p>
        <p>I skip to the <span class="UIcomponent">Run Model</span> tab and click the <span class="UIcomponent">Run Model</span> button.</p>

        </p>
        <p>When the map opens I&#160;click the <span class="UIcomponent">Compare on Ma</span>p button once more and open the <span class="UIcomponent">Layer List</span> so I&#160;can toggle between the comparison layers. </p>
        <p>Like before, I select the model change layer and see a reduction in flame lengths. Though I’m curious about these changes to fire behavior and fuel models, this is only a comparison of the original untreated landscape with this new treated landscape. What I really want to know is how much of an effect this added treatment of low severity wildfire, or a broadcast burn, will have compared to just the light thinning and pile burn I applied earlier. I need to compare the first treatment to the second one to get my answer.</p>
        <p>To best compare these “treatments” (default disturbance edits) on my landscape, I’ll first use the <span class="UIcomponent">Swipe Tool</span>. <span class="comment" MadCap:conditions="General.DeveloperNotes">check alt text for below and last of text formatting</span></p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/granite_crk_dta/dta2_newandoldbehavior.png" alt="add the two edited landscape files" />
        </p>
        <p>Click on <span class="UIcomponent">Simulation Output Tools</span> and check the boxes next to:</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
            <li>"Granite Creek LF2012 Light Thin Pile Rx 1yr Post Prop Trt Areas"</li>
            <li>"Granite Creek LF2012 Lt Thn Pl Rx 1yr LS WF 1yr"</li>
            <li>Make sure these layers are displayed at the top of the<span class="UIcomponent"> Layer List</span> dialogue box and click the <span class="UIcomponent">Swipe Tool</span>.</li>

            <img src="../../Resources/Images/granite_crk_dta/dta2_newoldbehavior_swipe.png" alt="swiping between fire behavior layers" />
        </p>
        <p>I open the <span class="UIcomponent">Swipe Tool</span> and make sure I have the right layers selected. I notice the Light Thin followed by a Pile Burn landscape is displayed on the top of the slider bar. The Light Thin, followed by a Pile Burn, followed by a Low Severity wildfire (Broadcast burn) landscape edit is on the bottom of the slider bar. Sliding back and forth, then looking at the legend, tells me that Flame Lengths were in fact reduced by up to a meter in some areas with just the addition of the Low Severity Wildfire! Next I want to see how my Fuel Models have changed with the addition of the Low Severity Wildfire.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/granite_crk_dta/dta2_other_layers.png" alt="Selecting fuel models to compare" />
        </p>
        <p>I set my <span class="UIcomponent">Layer List</span> up again, this time opening the <span class="UIcomponent">Landscape Tools</span> dialogue box to pull in my Landscape edits.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/granite_crk_dta/dta2_otherlayers_swipe.png" alt="swiping between landscape fuel models" />
        </p>
        <p>I can see from comparing these two edited landscapes, as well as the Landscape Change Map earlier,  that there was a significant shift in Fuel Model between the thinning/pile burn treatment, and the addition of the low severity wildfire. </p>
        <p>Next, I open the <span class="UIcomponent">Compare Summary Reports</span> so I can get the full picture and make a more informed decision about what treatments I should apply to achieve my preliminary objectives.</p>
        <p>I navigate to My Workspace and open the Fire Behavior Summary Compare Report.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/granite_crk_dta/dta2_report_flamelength1.png" alt="table and bar chart of flame length comparison" />
        </p>
        <p>The Fire Behavior Compare Reports for a modeled Light Thin/Pile Burn/Low Severity Broadcast Burn treatment show even more of a difference in pre- and post-treatment fire behavior.</p>
        <p>From the Flame Length Bar Chart, I can see a large increase in the post-treatment pixel count for lower Flame Length bins and no post-treatment pixels in the higher Flame Length bins.</p>
        <p>The table to the right indicates the pre-treatment percentage of pixels in the &gt;0-.3m Flame Length bin is 26%, while post-treatment the percentage went up to 86%. Conversely, the percentage of post-treatment pixels in the 3 highest Flame Length bins is 0, indicating a significant decrease in Flame Lengths post-treatment, across the treatment area.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/granite_crk_dta/dta2_report_flamelength2.png" alt="difference chart and pie chart of flame length comparisons" />
        </p>
        <p>The Percent Difference Graph for Flame Lengths demonstrates the shift toward lower Flame Lengths post-treatment. I can see the significant positive percent difference in the &gt;0 meter bin, while the bins correlating to higher Flame Lengths indicate a drop in the percent difference.</p>
        <p>The Pie Charts tell the same story, plainly showing the shift to significantly lower flame lengths in the post-treatment chart.</p>
        <p>I scroll through the rest of the fire behavior model outputs in the report. Their story is the same, significantly reduced Rates of Spread, as well as almost no Crown Fire Activity post-treatment.</p>
        <p>Next, I navigate back to <span class="UIcomponent">My Workspace</span> and open the Landscape Compare Summary Report.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/granite_crk_dta/dta2_report_fuelmodelcompare1.png" alt="fuel model bar chart and table comparison" />
        </p>
        <p>The Landscape Compare Reports for a modeled Light Thin/Pile Burn/Low Severity Broadcast Burn treatment show quite a change in Fuel Model pre- vs. post-treatment.</p>
        <p>From the compare bar graph, I can tell that a significant portion of the TL8 Fuel Model (Long-Needle Litter) has shifted to the GR2 (Low Load, Dry Climate Grass) and GS1 (Low Load, Dry Climate Grass-Shrub) Fuel Models, 1 year post-treatment. The table to the right confirms this quantitatively, indicating that 46% of the treatment area was comprised of a TL8 Fuel Model pre-treatment, while just 2% of the treatment area was a TL8 Fuel Model post-treatment. Conversely, none of the treatment area contained the GS1 Fuel Model pre-treatment, while post-treatment over 50% of the treatment area was comprised of Fuel Model GS1.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/granite_crk_dta/dta2_report_fuelmodelcompare2.png" alt="fuel model change chart and pie chart comparison" />
        </p>
        <p>The Percent Difference chart reflects the shift in Fuel Model displayed by the Bar Graph and table above, clearly showing the drop in the TL8 Fuel Model, as well as the increase in the GS1 Fuel Model post-treatment.</p>
        <p>The Pie Charts visually display these changes in Fuel Model as well.</p>
        <p>I review the rest of the Landscape Compare Summary Report and note the changes in the various landscape characteristics. I particularly note the increase in Canopy Base Height, as well as the decrease in Canopy Cover, post-treatment. This coincides with the information I’m seeing in the rest of the report, and reiterates the fact that this series of treatments will help me achieve my stated objectives, which were to: reduce surface fuel loading and the overall horizontal and vertical fuelbed continuity in order to reduce the fire hazard to adjacent private land and the community of Idaho City; and return low intensity fire to fire adapted vegetation communities.</p>

        <p>I could continue this process and model a more invasive treatment, such as heavier thinning or increased mortality from a more severe broadcast (prescribed) burn, but decide these results will achieve my initial preliminary objectives, and are a good place to start with my project proposal for the District ID Team.</p>
        <p>The results from the Compare Summary Reports, as well as those displayed spatially, will clearly demonstrate the need for treatment within the project areas I’ve identified. It’s clear that the expected fire behavior, given 97th percentile fire weather and fuel moisture conditions, in the identified treatment areas is much more intense than what would be considered characteristic in this frequent, but low intensity, fire regime. The reports and maps will demonstrate how these proposed treatments will help achieve the preliminary objectives to reduce surface fuel loading and the overall horizontal and vertical fuelbed continuity, as well as helping to return low intensity fire in these treatment areas.</p>
