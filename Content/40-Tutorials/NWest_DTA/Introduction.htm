        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>Annie is a Fuels Technician who needed to do a hazardous fuels reduction project on the Boise National Forest. Annie used <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> to save time in analysis by developing, modeling, comparing, and generating reports on hazardous fuels reduction treatments within a single interface. Below, she walks us step by step, start to finish, through her treatment development process. </p>
        <h2>Management Scenario</h2>
        <p>My name is Annie and I’m a Fuels Technician on the Idaho City Ranger District, Boise Nat’l Forest, about 30 miles northeast of Boise, Idaho. I’ve found I<MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> to be a useful tool in planning hazardous fuels reduction projects and want to share with you my process on one such project.</p>
        <p>Through observation and based on Forest Plan direction, I know we need some sort of fuels reduction treatment in the mixed conifer stands in Granite Creek drainage, approximately 4 miles east of Idaho City. The area hasn’t been treated in decades and the understory and surface fuels appear they would contribute to uncharacteristically intense fire behavior. This would not only pose a hazard to the community of Idaho City and adjacent private land, but would cause undue mortality in this fire adapted low elevation ponderosa pine ecosystem that thrives off of more frequent but less intense fire.</p>
        <p>Preliminarily, my objectives are to reduce surface fuel loading and the overall horizontal and vertical fuelbed continuity in order to reduce the fire hazard to adjacent private land and the community of Idaho City; and return low intensity fire to fire adapted vegetation communities. But where would our actions be most effective? What type of treatment would help me achieve these objectives? And how could I demonstrate the need for treatment, both quantitatively and spatially? I wanted a quick and efficient way to find an answers to these questions, as well as products I could use to inform members of our district interdisciplinary (ID) team of my findings. I turned to <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> for help with this.</p>

        <h2>Previewing the Area with <MadCap:variable name="General.MapStudio" /></h2>
        <p>My first stop was in <MadCap:variable name="General.MapStudio" /> so I could get a good look at the area I’m interested in, and create a landscape to start working off of.  I use the <span class="UIcomponent">+/-</span> buttons on the map to zoom in to the Granite Creek drainage. While doing so, I decide I’d rather use an imagery layer, so I use the <span class="UIcomponent">Basemap Gallery</span> button <img src="../../Resources/Images/mapstudio/button_basemapglry.png" alt="basemap gallery" /> at the bottom of the screen to change my basemap to "Imagery with Labels".</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/granite_crk_dta/map_studio_explore.png" alt="use map studio to explore your area" style="width: 833px;height: 527px;" />
        </p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
            <li>Access <MadCap:variable name="General.MapStudio" /> from the top navigation panel, visible on any page in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />.</li>
            <li>Use the <span class="UIcomponent">Zoom</span> buttons, your mouse, or the ESRI&#160;search box to find locations and explore your landscape.</li>
            <li>To change the basemap, use the <span class="UIcomponent">Basemap Gallery</span> button.</li>
            <li>Select a basemap for your viewing session, in this example, "Imagery with Labels".</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Create a Landscape</h2>
        <p>Next, I want to create my landscape, which will serve as a starting point for the rest of my analysis. To do this I:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/granite_crk_dta/obtain_landscape.png" alt="use the 'Landscape Tools' to add a new landscape" style="width: 748px;height: 435px;" class="border" />
        </p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
            <li> Click on the <span class="UIcomponent">Landscape Tools</span> button at the bottom of the screen.</li>
            <li>Select the <span class="UIcomponent">Create New</span> tab, to create a new landscape.</li>
            <li> Select <span class="UIcomponent">Draw Mode</span>, then drag across the area I’d like to analyze.  Alternatively, you can follow along by inputting the coordinates below directly:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>East: -115.5848</li>
                <li>West: -115.8096</li>
                <li>North: 43.8854</li>
                <li>South: 43.7675</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Select the version of LANDFIRE&#160;data I&#160;wanted, in this case 2012.</li>
            <li>Select the fire behavior fuel model type (13 or 40), here I&#160;have chosen Fuel Model 40.</li>
            <li>Name my new landscape "Granite Creek LF2012 unedited." I included the name, Landfire version, and its editing/treatment status will make it easier to discern this landscape from others once we start editing.</li>
            <li>Choose or create a new folder for this landscape. This is the folder the landscape will be stored in on My Workspace. Here I&#160;have created a "Granite Creek Treatments" folder</li>
            <li>Once everything looks good, I click on the <span class="UIcomponent">Create</span> button and wait a minute for my landscape to process.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Summarizing my Landscape</h2>
        <p>Next, I’d like to take a look at my newly created landscape on the map and get an idea of fire behavior. This can be done by creating a summary report and viewing the results in <MadCap:variable name="General.MapStudio" />:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/granite_crk_dta/summary.png" alt="landscape summary will summarize features and auto97th fire behavior" style="width: 782px;height: 450px;" />
        </p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
            <li> I  click on <span class="UIcomponent">Planning Cycle</span> in the top navigation.</li>
            <li>The cycle opens on the <span class="UIcomponent">Landscape Evaluation</span> stage by default, where I click the <span class="UIcomponent">Landscape Summary</span> task.</li>
            <li>In <span class="UIcomponent">Landscape Summary</span>, I click the dropdown box next to <span class="UIcomponent">My Landscapes</span>. My newly created landscape doesn’t appear in the drop down, so I type it in the blank box a the top of the list. My landscape appears with a green check next to it. From this same screen I can create an automated report to summarize not only the landscape characteristics, but the modeled fire behavior outputs specific to this landscape based on approximated worst case (97th percentile fuel moisture and wind) conditions.</li>
            <li>I click on <span class="UIcomponent">Request a Report</span> so my report can begin processing, it’ll take a few minutes. In the meantime, I close the Report dialogue box, then click on View in Map Studio so I can look at the map version of my landscape characteristics. Since I just clicked on Request a Report, 97th percentile modeled fire behavior will be available in Map Studio as well now.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Assessing the map and the report will allow me to learn more about the fuel characteristics and expected fire behavior on my landscape, thus informing where I may place fuels treatments, as well as what kinds of treatments I may need to achieve my objectives. Later, I can use <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> to compare expected fire behavior using various simulated treatments in my project area.</p>
        <h2>Assessing my Landscape</h2>
        <p>Next, I"ll assess my landscape using various tools in <MadCap:variable name="General.MapStudio" />:</p>
        <h3>Identify Tool</h3>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/granite_crk_dta/show_landscape.png" alt="Landscape Tools adds landscapes to map studio" style="width: 357px;height: 338px;" />
        </p>
        <p>Open <MadCap:variable name="General.MapStudio" /></p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
            <li>Use the <span class="UIcomponent">Landscape Tools</span> <img src="../../Resources/Images/mapstudio/button_landscapetools.png" alt="Landscape tools button" /> button to check your landscape under the "Add to Map" tab, to add it to Layer List and your map.</li>
            <div>
                <img src="../../Resources/Images/granite_crk_dta/layer_list_and_identify.png" alt="use the identify tool for more information" style="width: 602px;height: 361px;" />
            </div>
            <li>After opening the <span class="UIcomponent">Layer List</span> button <img src="../../Resources/Images/mapstudio/button_layerlist.png" alt="layer list button" />, I ensure my landscape is checked, then I can check and uncheck the landscape layers I’d like to view. I’d really like to look at the fuel models to make sure they correspond to what I’m seeing on the ground in this area, so I ensure that box is checked.</li>
            <li>I access more information for the landscape and subsequent layers via the small arrows next to the check boxes. In this case, I check the box next to "Fuel Models", then click on the arrow to access the Fuel Model layer legend.</li>
            <li>I click the <span class="UIcomponent">Identify</span> button <img src="../../Resources/Images/mapstudio/button_identify.png" alt="indentiry" /> in the upper right corner of the page to view more information for each pixel. I select the layer I’d like to view (current landscape), then click on the landscape in an area I’d like to know more about. The "Identify information box" populates with the landscape information for this pixel. For example, I now know that the green-blue pixels on the map correspond to areas of Fuel Model 188 (TL8). I continue checking out various areas of interest on my landscape to learn more about what fuel models are present and where. Notice that all of the landscape characteristics come up in the Identify box when you click on the landscape with the <img src="../../Resources/Images/mapstudio/button_identify.png" alt="indentiry" /> button, not just the characteristic you specified in your <span class="UIcomponent">Layer List</span>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/granite_crk_dta/transparency.png" alt="transparency can be set using the more options icon to the right of each layer" style="width: 332px;height: 428px;" />
        </p>
        <p>I’d like to see more of the features on the map, such as roads, and my landscape characteristics at the same time, so I click the 3 dots to the right of my Landscape name in <span class="UIcomponent">Layer List</span>. A dropdown box of options opens. I choose <span class="UIcomponent">Transparency</span>, which opens a slider bar allowing me to choose what level of transparency I’d like to see on my map.</p>
        <h3>Add reference data</h3>
        <p>Before I do a full assessment of the landscape characteristics, I’d like to view previous fires that may have occurred in this area. Fortunately, this is easy to do:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/granite_crk_dta/add_reference_data.png" alt="use 'add reference data' to add historic disturbance information" style="width: 712px;height: 413px;" />
        </p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
            <li>Using <span class="UIcomponent">Add Reference Data</span> button <img src="../../Resources/Images/mapstudio/button_adref.png" alt="add reference data" /> at the bottom of the screen, I see there are many options for additional data layers, including "Ownership" and "Critical Habitat Areas". </li>
            <li>For now, I’m only interested in "Disturbance History" – both "Historic Fuel Treatment Polygons", as well as "Historic Wildfire Perimeters". I select both, and the years I’m interested in, so they’ll show up in my <span class="UIcomponent">Layer List</span> and on my map.</li>
            <li>I use the <span class="UIcomponent">Identify </span>tool to identify the exact year of the Rabbit Creek and Bannock fires. Then I click the applicable Fire Perimeter layers on and off so I can assess the landscape and fuel models underneath to ensure they’re reflective of these fires.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>I follow this same process with the Historic Fuel Treatment Polygons layer as well.</p>
        <p>After doing an assessment of all the landscape characteristics (Elevation, Slope, Aspect, Canopy Cover, Stand Height, Canopy Base Height and Canopy Bulk Density) I determine that the Landfire 2012 data, which was used to develop this landscape, is reflective of existing conditions, including previous fires. If there had been a more recent disturbance (since this Landfire layer was produced in 2012), such as a fire or fuels treatment I wanted to mimic on this landscape, I could easily create a polygon to reflect this area of interest, then make the appropriate landscape edits to reflect the disturbance on the landscape (More information on Landscape Editing is available via the <a href="../../30-Tasks/LndscpEdit/LandscapeEditAbout.htm" target="_blank">Landscape Editing Topic</a>.</p>
        <h3>Comparing Landscape Features and Model Outputs with the Swipe Tool</h3>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/granite_crk_dta/auto97_flame_length.png" alt="use 'simulation output tools' to add the auto97th model outputs" style="width: 742px;height: 452px;" />
        </p>
        <p>Now that I have a good idea of the specific characteristics of my landscape, I want to look at the expected fire behavior using 97th percentile weather and fuel moisture conditions. We ran the summary earlier, and have to add it to the map to do this I:</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
            <li>Click the <span class="UIcomponent">Simulation Output Tools</span> button <img src="../../Resources/Images/mapstudio/button_SimOutput.png" alt="simulation output tools" /> on the bottom of the screen.</li>
            <li>Check the box next to “Granite Creek LF2012 unedited-Auto97th” to add the fire behavior layer to <span class="UIcomponent">Layer List</span> and my map. I check the appropriate boxes in the Layer List dialogue box so I can view Flame Lengths and the corresponding legend.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>I zoom into an orange/red area where I can see concentrated areas of expected high Flame Lengths. I want to know what the topography and fuel models are where I’m seeing the more intense fire behavior.</p>
        <p>I set up my Layer List to have the Fuel Model checked for the Granite Creek Landscape layer, as well as Flame Lengths for the Auto97th modeled fire behavior output. I can quickly switch between layers to view changes by checking/unchecking the layers, or by using the <span class="UIcomponent">Swipe Tool</span><img src="../../Resources/Images/mapstudio/button_slider.png" alt="swipe tool" />.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/granite_crk_dta/swipe_pretreatment.png" alt="using the swipe tool in the top right can help evaluate our landscape" style="width: 765px;height: 400px;" />
        </p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
            <li>I click the <span class="UIcomponent">Swipe Tool</span><img src="../../Resources/Images/mapstudio/button_slider.png" alt="swipe tool" />.</li>
            <li>Next, I&#160;specify the layers I&#160;want to swipe - the first layer I select will be the layer I view on the top of the slider bar, the second layer checked in <span class="UIcomponent">Layer List</span> will be the layer on the bottom of the slider bar. In this case, Granite Creek LF2012 unedited – Auto97th layer. I slide the bar in the middle of the screen up and down and I can see that the areas with high flame lengths correspond to areas of Fuel Model 188 and 165, which is what I suspected.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/granite_crk_dta/swipe_pretreatment2.png" alt="swipe tool showing topography below the layer" style="width: 604px;height: 298px;" />
        </p>
        <p>Additionally, I want to view the topography layer underneath to see if there is a theme in the areas displaying more intense fire behavior. I uncheck the boxes in the <span class="UIcomponent">Layer List</span> then re-click the Granite Creek LF2012 unedited – Auto97th.This will display only the behavior layer, and allow us to see the topography underneath. If this does not occur on your map, try selecting the Model Output: Granite Creek by clicking on it from the Swipe dialog that appears in the top right. </p>
        <p>As I swipe up and down I can see that the areas displaying the more intense fire behavior are all west or northwest facing slopes. I complete further analysis by repeating this process in the northern part of my landscape where there appears to be several areas that would produce more intense fire behavior. I also compare other aspects of fire behavior, such as Rate of Spread and Crown Fire Activity.</p>
        <p>With this information, I decide to create two separate Areas of Interest, or areas on which I’d like to focus my analysis and treatments.</p>
        <h2>Creating Areas of Interest</h2>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/granite_crk_dta/create_aoi_1.png" alt="set the layer list to view flame length" style="width: 578px;height: 378px;" />
        </p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
            <li>To create an Area of Interest, or polygon, I change the <span class="UIcomponent">Basemap Gallery</span> layer to “Imagery with Labels” so I can see landscape imagery.</li>
            <li> Then I set up my <span class="UIcomponent">Layer List </span>to show my 97th percentile fire behavior output layer for Flame Lengths, and set the transparency so I can see roads and topography as I create my Area of Interest, or treatment area.</li>
            <div>
                <img src="../../Resources/Images/granite_crk_dta/create_treatment_polys2.png" alt="use 'create/edit' shapes to create treatment polygons" style="width: 865px;height: 403px;" />
            </div>
            <li>I select the <span class="UIcomponent">Create/Edit Shapes</span> button <img src="../../Resources/Images/mapstudio/button_editTools.png" alt="create or edit shapes" /> at the bottom of the screen and ensure <span class="UIcomponent">Polygons</span> is selected in the dropdown box in <span class="UIcomponent">Create/Edit Shapes</span>. </li>
            <li>Then I select <span class="UIcomponent">Freehand Polygon</span> button <img src="../../Resources/Images/mapstudio/button_edittools_freehand.png" alt="freehand draw button" /> , draw a shape around one of my areas, then select the button again and draw a shape around the second area. I’ve selected two areas in my landscape that exhibited high modeled fire intensity. I’d like to concentrate on these areas as far as comparing treatments that may help me meet my preliminary objectives of reducing the fire hazard in this area, as well as returning low intensity fire to this landscape.</li>
            <li>To save these two treatments as one set of shapefiles, I click the <span class="UIcomponent">Copy from Existing Features</span> button <img src="../../Resources/Images/mapstudio/button_copy_exstng_ftrs.png" alt="copy from exisitng features button" style="width: 23px;height: 23px;" />, check the <span class="UIcomponent">Select multipart</span> button option, single left-click one shape, then single left click the other shape, then proceed to naming.</li>
            <li>After drawing my shapes, I name this Area of Interest “Granite Creek Proposed Treatment Areas”, then I save this new shape to my existing "Granite Creek Treatments" folder. This will ensure this Area of Interest is filed in the same location in <span class="UIcomponent">My Workspace</span> as all my other Granite Creek project files.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Reviewing a Landscape Summary Report</h2>
        <p>Now that I’ve thoroughly reviewed my landscape and modeled fire behavior on the map, as well as identified the areas on which I’d like to focus treatments, I want to take a look at the corresponding landscape and fire behavior summary reports. </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/granite_crk_dta/view_summary.png" alt="click the 'view summary' button to review reports" style="width: 630px;height: 203px;" />
        </p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
            <li>I navigate away from Map Studio and click on <span class="UIcomponent">My Workspace</span> at the top of the screen,</li>
            <li>select my "Granite Creek Treatments Folder" in the left hand panel. As I&#160;navigate  I notice  the information in the Right Hand Panel changes as well. It appears to update as I move through different screens. </li>
            <li>select the "Granite Creek LF2012 unedited - Auto97th" report file and click the <span class="UIcomponent">View Summary</span> button.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The Landscape, as well as the Model Output and the Summary Reports, are all contained in my Granite Creek Fuels folder.</p>
        <p>I want to view the reports, so I click on the top file.</p>
        <p>The option to <span class="UIcomponent">View Summary</span> appears, so I click on that and take a look at my reports.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/granite_crk_dta/report_fuel_model.png" alt="summary reports generate a variety of outputs, table, pie charts, bar charts." style="width: 561px;height: 388px;" />
        </p>
        <p>All of the Landscape characteristics, as well as Fire Behavior outputs, I’ve just viewed in Map Studio are quantitatively displayed in several different formats in this report. I find a lot of value in these reports because they break each component (Canopy Cover, Canopy Base Height, Rate of Spread, etc.) down in a way that makes it even easier, after viewing the spatial data, to really assess your landscape and 97th percentile modeled fire behavior. For example, in viewing the Fuel Model map (upper left corner), I can see that I have a lot of Fuel Model TL8 on my landscape, but it’s not until I take a look at the graphs that I can really assess that, in fact, 35% of this landscape is attributed to the TL8 fuel model.</p>
        <p>I take a good look at the report in it’s entirety.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/granite_crk_dta/report_flame_length.png" alt="reports include flame length and other fire behavior measurements" style="width: 593px;height: 418px;" />
        </p>
        <p>Example of the outputs for the Fire Behavior portion of the report. These graphs indicate that, given 97th percentile weather and fuel moisture conditions, approximately a 1/3rd of this landscape will experience Flame Lengths of &gt;0 - .3 meters, while another 1/3rd will experience Flame Lengths &gt;.3 - 1.2 meters. I plan to focus my treatments in the specific areas on this landscape where I’m noticing more intense, “problem” fire behavior, from both an ecological and a control perspective.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/granite_crk_dta/report_flamelength_map.png" alt="details are displayed on the bottom right of the report maps" style="width: 704px;height: 746px;" />
        </p>
        <p>I notice the Auto97th Fire Behavior section of the report has recorded the 97th percentile weather and fuel moisture inputs used to run the fire behavior model. I make note of these inputs as I’m interested in running the fire behavior model on some of my treatment areas and will want to use the 97th percentile values to do so.</p>
        <p>Next its time to develop some treatment alternatives.</p>
