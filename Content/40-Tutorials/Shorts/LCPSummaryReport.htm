        <h1>Landscape Summary Report</h1>
        <p>A landscape summary report provides a quick way to run a fire behavior model under severe weather conditions for a landscape and view results both geospatially, and as a report. Fuel moistures are automatically populated using the 97th percentile weather conditions recorded at the Remote Automated Weather Station (RAWS) nearest to your area. (More information on Auto97th RAWS selection can be found in the <a href="../../30-Tasks/Summaries/Auto97Summary.htm" target="_blank">Landscape/Auto97th Summary  Report Documentation Topic</a>).</p>
        <p>Following along from the previous tutorial, we'll begin these instructions from the Landscape Summary page. If you had navigated away from that page: You can return to it via the Cycle option in the top navigation menu, click the Landscape Evaluation stage of the cycle, and click the Landscape Summary option.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>A) Make sure your landscape of choice appears in the <span class="UIcomponent">Select Landscape</span> menu, in this example, 'HaypressLF2012unedited'. Leave the <span class="UIcomponent">Area of Interest</span> blank for this example, but if you had one to constrain your summary area, it could be entered here. Click the <span class="UIcomponent">Request a Report</span> button.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/landscapesumm/summary_report_prompt.png" title="create a summary report" style="width: 638px;height: 303px;" alt="text in a pop up window promts you to create a summary reoprt" class="border" />
        </p>
        <p>B) A prompt appears with the name of your landscape across the top. Click <span class="UIcomponent">Create Report</span> to generate the Summary Report.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/landscapesumm/summary_confirmation.png" alt="green confirmation text box appears to let you know your summary is being generated" style="width: 340px; height: 196px;" title="Screen shot of a fire behavior summary report being generated" class="border" />
        </p>
        <p>C) The <img src="../../Resources/Images/buttons_general/hourglass.png" alt="hourglass" title="Hourglass icon" /> icon indicates the Summary Report is being generated. You can use the <span class="UIcomponent">Refresh</span> button <img src="../../Resources/Images/buttons_general/button_refresh.png" alt="refresh" /> to check the status of the report. It may take a couple minutes to generate.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/landscapesumm/report link confirmation box.png" alt="the report name will become a hyperlink when the report is complete" style="width: 612px; height: 142px;" class="border" />
        </p>
        <p>D) When finished, your Summary Report will become an active hyperlink, and a green checkmark will appear next to it. Clicking it from this confirmation dialogue box will open the report. Later, as you navigate through <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />, you will be able to view this report again from <span class="UIcomponent">My Workspace</span>, in the same folder as your landscape.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/landscapesumm/report link click.png" alt="click the report link to open it" style="width: 750px; height: 175px;" class="border" />
        </p>
        <p>E) Click the Report link and give it a quick overview to become familiar with its layout. Note the landscape data and model run parameters outlined along the top, the map, table, bar, and pie charts available for the landscape and behavior outputs, and the ability to jump to a specific output using the left-hand menu. When finished, click the download icon in the top-right, and download a pdf to your location machine.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/landscapesumm/summary_sections.png" alt="landscape information and model parameters are displayed along the top." style="width: 1004px; height: 492px;" class="border" />
        </p>
        <p>F) With your summary is created, navigate to <span class="UIcomponent">My Workspace</span>, and view the fire behavior outputs in <MadCap:variable name="General.MapStudio" />:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/landscapesumm/myworkspace_access_report.png" alt="access model output from My Workspace" class="border" />
        </p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
            <li>Click on My Workspace</li>
            <li>Click the Haypress Creek Project folder</li>
            <li>Find the Landscape summary model output 'HaypressCrkLF2012unedited-Auto97th.</li>
            <li>Click the <span class="UIcomponent">View on Map</span> button.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>G) Use the <span class="UIcomponent">Layer List</span> and <span class="UIcomponent">Zoom</span> to evaluate fire behavior across your landscape, focusing in on theSierra City wildand urban interface in the northeast  of the map.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/landscapesumm/view_model_onMap.png" alt="model outputs may be viewed in Map Studio"  class="border"/>
        </p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
            <li>Open the <span class="UIcomponent">Basemap Gallery</span></li>
            <li>Select 'Imagery with Labels'</li>
            <li>Open <span class="UIcomponent">Layer List</span></li>
            <li>Make sure your model output is checked and note the model outputs available (flame length, rate of spread, fireline intensity, heat per unit area, crown fire activity, and maximum spread direction).</li>
            <li>You may need to adjust the transparency to better view the outputs with your map imagery. Click the <span class="UIcomponent">More Options</span> button <img src="../../Resources/Images/buttons_general/button_moreoptions.png" alt="more options" />to the right of the 'Model Outputs' layer, and click <span class="UIcomponent">Transparency</span>. A slider will allow you to adjust the layer transparency. The model layer in this imagery has a transparency of about 60%.</li>
            <div class="notificationTip">
                <p>As you evaluate your landscape you may find it helpful to adjust the layer transparency using the <span class="UIcomponent">more options</span> button <img src="../../Resources/Images/buttons_general/button_moreoptions.png" alt="moreoptionsbutton" /> to the right of your fire behavior layer, and the different <span class="UIcomponent">basemap gallery</span><img src="../../Resources/Images/mapstudio/button_basemapglry.png" alt="basemap gallery button" />options.</p>
            </div>
            <li>Zoom into the Sierra City area by double left-clicking, or using the <span class="UIcomponent">+ Zoom</span> button in the top left of the map.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>H) Toggling through the fire behavior attributes of flame length, and canopy fire, we can see some areas north of town, and east between the North Yuba River and some wildland urban interface. These areas could make good candidates for treatment. In this example you'll notice the circled areas indicate potentially high flame lengths, rates of spread, active crown fire, and a max spread direction moving north to northeast.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/tutorial_1_comparison/SierraCity2.png" alt="possible treatment areas as described in text" style="width: 1184px; height: 590px;" class="border" />
        </p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="General.DeveloperNotes">You may also use the <span class="UIcomponent">Landscape Tools</span><img src="../../Resources/Images/mapstudio/button_landscapetools.png" alt="landscape tools button" class="button" /> button to add the landscape file to <MadCap:variable name="General.MapStudio" />, and the <span href="../../10-MapStudio/Functions/Swipe.htm" target="_blank" class="UIcomponent"><a href="../../10-MapStudio/Functions/Swipe.htm" target="_blank">Swipe</a></span> tool <img src="../../Resources/Images/mapstudio/button_slider.png" alt="swipe tool button" class="button" /> to view the different landscape layers and fire behavior attributes.</p>
        <p>In the next steps, we'll create shapefiles for these areas, then use those shapefiles to specify which part of the landscape to simulate our treatment alternatives for comparison.</p>
