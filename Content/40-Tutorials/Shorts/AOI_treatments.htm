        <h1>Creating Treatment Polygons</h1>
        <p>To simulate and evaluate the impact of treatments, we'll delineate our planned treatment areas with shapes in <MadCap:variable name="General.MapStudio" />. First we will create a polygon for each treatment area, next we will combine those into one shapefile so we can use the combined file in our comparison. </p>
        <p>First, we'll create three individual shapes:</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
            <li> Open <span class="UIcomponent">Create/Edit Shapes</span> <img src="../../Resources/Images/mapstudio/create_edit_shp/button_editTools.png" alt="create edit shapes button" class="button" /> </li>
            <li>Select your method, in this case the freehand draw method</li>
            <li>Draw your polygon. You can use the <span class="UIcomponent">delete button</span><img src="../../Resources/Images/mapstudio/create_edit_shp/button_edittools_clear.png" alt="delete button" class="button" /> to remove the polygon if you are not satisfied with it. </li>
            <li>Give your polygon a name, such as "Treatment Unit 1"</li>
            <li>Specify a folder to store the file, in this case "Haypress Creek&#160;Project"</li>
            <li>
                <p>Click Create. Now repeat the process and draw two additional polygons. You may refer to the image at the bottom of this page for a visual reference if you prefer to approximate the polygons we drew in this example. Your polygons do not need to exactly match our example.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Your polygons will initially show up highlighted in yellow. You will want to save the three of these as one shape for later use in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />. To do this:</p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../Resources/Snippets/MapStudio/Shapefile_Save_multiple.flsnp" />
        <p>When completed, your polygons will change from highlighted to a purple shaded outline on the map  as shown below.</p>

        </p>
        <p>(<a href="../../10-MapStudio/Functions/EditTools.htm" target="_blank">You may also upload shapefiles if you prefer</a>)</p>
        <p>Saved shapes are available in <span class="UIcomponent">My Workspace </span>in the folder you selected (in this case the Haypress Creek Project folder).</p>
