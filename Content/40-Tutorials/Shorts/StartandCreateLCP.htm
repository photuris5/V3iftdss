        <h1>Starting a Project and Creating a Landscape</h1>
        <h2>Using Folders and Landscapes in IFTDSS</h2>
        <p><b>Project Folders:</b> There is no formal definition of the term “Project" in IFTDSS. Instead, the term “<span class="Emphasis">Project”</span> refers to the collection of landscape files, model runs, and associated data for your specific area. Many tasks in IFTDSS relate back to these landscape files and other information, so it is recommended that you start by creating a <span class="Emphasis">Folder</span> to keep track of your files.</p>
        <div class="notificationTip">
            <p>Tip: Stay organized by creating a Folder each time you begin a project for analysis.  Logical naming conventions for Folders include the geographic area being analyzed.</p>
        </div>
        <p><b>Landscapes:</b> In IFTDSS, a landscape file refers to the spatial file that contains vegetation and fuels data.  The user defines the extent of the landscape which should be large enough to cover the entire analysis area.  IFTDSS currently generates all landscape files at 30m resolution and can accommodate large landscapes if necessary.  The maximum area for a landscape is 12,188,160 acres (138 miles x 138 miles) but if you try that now, your instructor will not be pleased. If you follow along with your own landscape, limit the size to under 100,000 acres to reduce the processing times.</p>
        <p>If you do not specify a folder to store data in IFTDSS, files will be saved to the “Playground” Folder by default. Currently, files cannot be moved from one folder to another.</p>
        <div class="notificationNote">
            <p>Tutorial Information:</p>
            <p>If you wish to follow along replicating the exact steps captured by these tutorials, we have included that information (such as landscape coordinates, model inputs, etc), in blue highlighting throughout.</p>
            <p>You may also follow the general steps in these tutorials using your own landscape, in which case you may ignore the blue highlighted information.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Create a Folder</h2>
        <p>Folders can be created directly in <span class="UIcomponent">My Workspace</span>. They can also be created while working in IFTDSS whenever you create a new landscape or shapefile, just look for the <span class="UIcomponent">Add New Folder</span> <img src="../../Resources/Images/buttons_general/add_new_folder.png" alt="add new folder" class="iftbutton" /> button whenever you are required to specify a folder.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/getting_started/add_folder.png" alt="you may specify which folder to store a file from many areas of IFTDSS." class="border" />
        </p>
        <p>To create a new folder from <span class="UIcomponent">My Workspace</span>:</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
            <li>
                <p>Access <span class="UIcomponent">My Workspace</span> from the top navigation menu of <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> and create a folder by clicking the <span class="UIcomponent">Create Folder</span> option at the top of the <span class="UIcomponent">My Workspace</span> page.</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../Resources/Images/myworkspace/create_folder.png" alt="create a folder from the &quot;Create Folder&quot; option at the top of My Workspace." class="borderlist" />
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Give your folder a name and click <span class="UIcomponent">Submit</span>. <span style="background-color: #add8e6;">For this tutorial we’ll name it “Haypress Creek Project”</span>.</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../Resources/Images/myworkspace/workspace_foldername04182017.png" alt="click &quot;submit&quot; to submit a new folder" class="borderlist" />
                </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p><b>Deleting Folders</b>: You can delete a folder in My Workspace if needed, but you must make sure the folder is empty first.</p>
        <p>To delete a folder in <span class="UIcomponent">My Workspace</span>, hover over the folder name in the left panel, a  red 'x' will appear to the right of the folder name. Click the red x and confirm your deletion when prompted.</p>
        <p>To delete a folder with files, you must first open the folder and delete the individual files and then delete the folder. File deletions will come with a warning about any dependencies and ask for verification before deletion.<img src="../../Resources/Images/myworkspace/delete_folder.png" alt="To be able to delete a folder, it cannot contain files used by any other processes in IFTDSS at the time of its deletion" class="border" /></p>
        <h2>Create a Landscape</h2>
        <p>Landscapes in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> can be created from multiple locations. In most interfaces it is common to see both a drop-down menu for existing landscapes and options to create new landscapes within the interface or from <MadCap:variable name="General.MapStudio" />.</p>
        <p>For this tutorial you’ll create a landscape through the <span class="UIcomponent">Landscape Summary</span> task. This serves two purposes: to create a landscape, and to do so in an interface where you can easily create a downloadable summary report describing the characteristics of your landscape.</p>
        <div class="notificationTip">
            <p><b>Tip:</b> Landscapes created elsewhere in IFTDSS are available via the My Landscapes drop-down menu in the Landscape Summary task, so you can create summaries at any point in time.</p>
        </div>
        <h3>Navigate to the <span class="UIcomponent">Landscape Summary</span> interface:</h3>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
            <li>Navigate to the Planning <span class="UIcomponent">“Cycle</span>” using the top navigation menu.</li>
            <li>Select the <span class="UIcomponent">Landscape Evaluation</span> stage of the Planning Cycle.</li>
            <li>
                <p>Click the <span class="UIcomponent">Landscape Summary</span> task.</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../Resources/Images/landscapesumm/get_to_summary.png" alt="Use the &quot;Landscape Evaluation&quot; stage of the Planning Cycle to find the &quot;Landscape Summary&quot; option." class="borderlist" />
                </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>For the next steps we will outline creating a landscape using two methods: the <span class="UIcomponent">Create Here</span> option, and <span class="UIcomponent">Create in Map Studio</span> option.  Briefly look at each option and follow along with the option of your choosing.</p>

                <p>Follow these steps to create a landscape:</p>
                <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
                    <li>
                        <p>Use the bounding box fields and enter the coordinates, in degrees, for the west, east, south, and north bounds of your area, or select the <span class="UIcomponent">Draw Tool</span> and click on the map to draw a box around your area. The dimensions of your selected area will be displayed to the left, or under your landscape coordinates, depending on what part of <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName"></MadCap:variable> you create your landscape in.</p>
                        <p>

                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Choose the version of LANDFIRE data you would like to use from the drop-down list. <span style="background-color: #add8e6;">We chose Landfire 2012</span>.</li>
                    <li>Choose the fire behavior fuel model (Fuel Model 40 or Fuel Model 13) to include in your landscape file from the drop-down list. <span style="background-color: #add8e6;">We chose Fuel Model 40</span>.</li>
                    <li>Give your landscape a descriptive name, this will be helpful as you accumulate more landscape files in IFTDSS. <span style="background-color: #add8e6;">We named this “HaypressCrklf2012unedited”</span>.</li>
                    <li>Select the folder where you would like to store your landscape file, or click <span class="UIcomponent">+ Folder</span> to create and name a new folder to place your landscape file. <span style="background-color: #add8e6;">We saved this in the “Haypress Creek" Project Folder.</span></li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Click <span class="UIcomponent">Create</span> to generate your landscape file.</p>

                </ol>
                <p>Once you click <span class="UIcomponent">Create</span>, you will be returned to the Landscape Summary task, and the field next to <span class="UIcomponent">My Landscapes</span> displays the name of your newly created landscape with an hourglass <img src="../../Resources/Images/buttons_general/hourglass.png" alt="hourglass" class="iftbutton"></img>next to it. This indicates it is being created. Once created, the hourglass is replaced by a green checkmark. Use the <span class="UIcomponent">Refresh</span><img src="../../Resources/Images/buttons_general/button_refresh.png" alt=" refresh" class="iftbutton"></img> button next to the landscape name to see the green checkmark.</p>

                <p>Next you will use <span class="UIcomponent">Landscape Tools</span> to create your landscape:</p>
                <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
                    <li>Use the <MadCap:variable name="General.MapStudio" /> widgets such as zoom, Basemap Gallery, ESRI Search, etc. to locate your desired area.</li>
                    <li>If you want to draw your extent, click the <span class="UIcomponent">Select draw mode</span>, mouse to your location on the map, hold down the left mouse key, and draw a rectangle around your desired area, releasing the button when you are finished.

                    <li>Choose the version of LANDFIRE data you would like to use. <span style="background-color: #add8e6;">We chose Landfire 2012</span>.</li>
                    <li>Choose the fire behavior fuel model (Fuel Model 40 or Fuel Model 13) you would like included in your landscape file. <span style="background-color: #add8e6;">We chose Fuel Model 40</span>.</li>
                    <li>Give your landscape a descriptive name, this will be helpful as you accumulate more landscape files in IFTDSS. It can be helpful to specify the Landfire Version in the name and to say unedited if you anticipate that you will need to update this file. <span style="background-color: #add8e6;">We named this “HaypressCrklf2012unedited</span>”.</li>
                    <li>Select the folder in which you would like to store your landscape file. <span style="background-color: #add8e6;">We saved this in the “Haypress Creek Project Folder”</span>.</li>

        <h2>Next Steps</h2>
        <p>When your landscape is completed, navigate back to the <span class="UIcomponent">Landscape Summary</span> task, and select your new landscape from the drop-down menu.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/landscapesumm/t_available_lcps.png" alt="choose your landscape from the drop-down" class="border" />
        </p>
        <p>You have successfully created your landscape from within the <span class="UIcomponent">Landscape Summary</span> interface. Stay on this task and go to the next tutorial, where you will look at the different types of summaries and finish this Landscape Summary. Note that your landscape has been permanently created, and will now be available for use throughout <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />.</p>
