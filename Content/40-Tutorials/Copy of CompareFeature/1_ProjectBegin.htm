        <h1>Beginning a Project</h1>
        <p>There is no formal definition of 'project' for <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />, rather, the term refers to the collection of landscape files, model runs, and associated data for your specific area. Before beginning, create a folder for your project in <span class="UIcomponent">My Workspace</span>, to help keep track of your files as they are generated. To create a folder in <span class="UIcomponent">My Workspace</span>:</p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../Resources/Snippets/MyWorkspace/CreateFolderPart_1.flsnp" />
        <p>Give your folder a name, in this example 'Haypress Creek Project', and click <span class="UIcomponent">Submit</span>.</p>
