        <h1>Create a landscape</h1>
        <p>Landscape in IFTDSS can be created in multiple ways. For example, you could go to <MadCap:variable name="General.MapStudio" /> and create a landscape using <span class="UIcomponent">Landscape Tools</span>. But for this tutorial we’ll create a new landscape by going into the Planning Cycle, Landscape Evaluation, and Landscape Summary. </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Cycle/LandscapeEvaluationSummary.png" alt="Landscape evaluation stage of the planning cycle with the 'landscape summary' task highlighted." style="width: 881px; height: 247px;" class="border" />
        </p>
        <p>We can view the landscape in <span class="UIcomponent">My Workspace</span> once its created, but hold off on looking at the landscape summary, because we know we’ll want to make some edits to the landscape for this tutorial.</p>
        <p>We will look at a portion of the Tahoe National Forest located at:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>West: -120.8856 degrees</li>
            <li>East: -120.6044 degrees</li>
            <li>South: 39.4463  degrees</li>
            <li>North: 39.6149  degrees </li>
        </ul>
        <div class="notificationTip">
            <p>To help keep track of your data, we recommend including the LANDFIRE version in the name.</p>
        </div>
        <p>For this example landscape we are about to create, we will name it:&#160;'HaypressCrk LF2012 Unedited'</p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../Resources/Snippets/GenerateLandscape/LCPinInterface.flsnp" />
        <p>Once you click <span class="UIcomponent">Create</span>, you will be returned to the Landscape&#160;Summary task, and the field next to <span class="UIcomponent">My Landscapes</span>, displays the name of your newly created landscape, with an hourglass <img src="../../Resources/Images/buttons_general/hourglass.png" alt="hourglass icon"></img>next to it, indicating it is being created. Once created, the hourglass is replaced by a green checkmark. You may have to use the refresh button next to the landscape name to see the green checkmark</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/lcp_gen_smmry/landscaperefresh.png" alt="Landscapes still being processed in IFTDSS often have a red hourglass next to their name" style="width: 827px; height: 418px;" class="border" />
        </p>
        <p>If you prefer to create your landscape in <MadCap:variable name="General.MapStudio" />, you may navigate to <MadCap:variable name="General.MapStudio" />, create a landscape using the <span class="UIcomponent">Landscape Tool</span> <img src="../../Resources/Images/mapstudio/button_landscapetools.png" alt="landscape tool button" class="button" />, and navigating back to your desired location in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />. Visit the <a href="../../10-MapStudio/Files/LCPCreate.htm" target="_blank">Creating a Landscape Topic</a> for more details on this. </p>
        <div class="notificationTip">
            <p>You can toggle different basemaps (using <span class="UIcomponent">Basemap Gallery</span>) and Reference Layers (using <span class="UIcomponent">Add Reference Layers</span>) in <MadCap:variable name="General.MapStudio" /> to help you locate the area you would like to create a landscape for.</p>
        </div>
        <p>For the next step we'll go back to the Landscape Evaluation stage of the planning cycle and edit using the Landscape Edit Task</p>
