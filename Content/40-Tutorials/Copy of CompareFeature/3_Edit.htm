        <h1>Evaluate the landscape and edit it to reflect the current conditions on the ground using the Landscape Evaluation stage of the planning cycle</h1>
        <p>Now that we have our landscape, we can make edits if necessary so it reflects our landscapes existing condition as close as possible. For your own landscape, you’ll have your own editing to do, but for this hypothetical example, we’ll say that we want to reduce the canopy cover in all TU5 areas by 5%.</p>

        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
            <li>Choose the <span class="UIcomponent">Starting Landscape</span> you want to edit, HaypressCrk LF2012 Unedited</li>
            <li>View the Add User Created Edit Rule options by selecting the drop-down arrow to the far right of the <span class="UIcomponent">Add User&#160;Created Edit Rule</span> heading.</li>
            <li>Specify the conditions you would like to select in the fields below <span class="UIcomponent">Where these conditions exist</span>. In this example we have selected "Fuel Model" as the Attribute, "is equal to" as the Operator and fire behavior fuel model "165 (TU5)" as the Value. This selected all TU5 fuel modeled areas across the landscape.</li>
            <li>Specify the conditions you would like to change by populating the fields below <span class="UIcomponent">Modify the following values</span>. In this example we have selected "Canopy Cover" as the Attribute, "decrease by" as the Operator, and "5" (for 5 percent) as the Value. For all TU5 fuel modeled areas, the application decreases the canopy cover by 5 percent. </li>
            <li>The <span class="UIcomponent">Apply to Landscape Mask</span> (optional) drop-down allows you to select a shapefile  these edits will be contained. We will leave this field blank, which will apply our edit to the entire landscape.</li>
            <li>When you are ready to apply this rule click <span class="UIcomponent">Add to Rules</span>. Notice the rule has been added to the list, and the order noted. You can delete rules before saving by using the delete button <img src="../../Resources/Images/buttons_general/button_delete.png" alt="delete button" title="Image of the Delete Button" /> to the right of each rule. </li>

                    <p>Rules are applied top to bottom, first by Default Fuels Treatment / Disturbance Edit Rules then by user defined User Created Edit Rules.

            <li>Once you entered all the rules in the order you would like them applied, give your landscape a descriptive name. In this case we will end our landscape name with "EC" ("Haypress Crk LF2012 EC") as a reminder that this is our existing condition landscape, not our unedited landscape. Click <span class="UIcomponent">Save New Landscape</span>. Your original landscape remains in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />, and now an edited copy is available throughout <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />.</li>
