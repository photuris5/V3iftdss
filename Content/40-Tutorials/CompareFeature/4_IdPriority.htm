        <h1>Identify a priority treatment area using the Auto97th fire behavior summary and examining Wildland Urban Interface Areas in Map Studio</h1>
        <p>To identify the areas that would be good candidates for treatment, we’ll create a summary report using the Auto 97th<a href="../../30-Tasks/Summaries/LandSummaryAbout.htm" target="_blank"> Summary</a>, this will automatically populate a Landscape Fire Behavior model with 97th percentile moisture conditions based on the Remote Automatic Weather Station (RAWS) nearest our area (see <a href="../../30-Tasks/Summaries/Auto97Summary.htm" target="_blank">Auto 97th Technical details</a> for more information on this process). This will generate both a report, and a mapped output. We'll look at the mapped output.</p>
        <p>To begin, go back to the Landscape Evaluation stage of the planning cycle, and click the Landscape Summary task:&#160;</p>
        <p>For your Landscape, specify a starting landscape to represent fie behavior on an untreated landscape as it currently exists. For this tutorial, we'll select the Existing Condition landscape we just created:&#160;"HaypressCrkLF2012EC"</p>
        <p>After you have specified your landscape, and (optional) Area of Interest, click <span class="UIcomponent">Request a Report</span>.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>A prompt appears with the name of your landscape across the top. Click <span class="UIcomponent">Create Report</span> to generate the Summary Report.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Summary/summary_report_prompt.png" title="create a summary report" alt="text in a pop up window promts you to create a summary reoprt" class="border" />
        </p>
        <p>The <img src="../../Resources/Images/ButtonsGeneral/hourglass.png" alt="hourglass" title="Hourglass icon" /> icon indicates the Summary Report is being generated. You can refresh and check the status by clicking the refresh button <img src="../../Resources/Images/ButtonsGeneral/button_refresh.png" alt="refresh button" title="Refresh icon" />.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Summary/summary_confirmation.png" alt="green confirmation text box appears to let you know your summary is being generated" title="Screen shot of a fire behavior summary report being generated" class="border" />
        </p>
        <div class="notificationTip">
            <p>Depending upon landscape size, your summary may take a few minutes to complete.</p>
        </div>
        <p>When finished your Summary Report will be available by clicking on the report name in the confirmation dialogue box.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Summary/report link confirmation box.png" alt="the report name will become a hyperlink when the report is complete" class="border" />
        </p>
        <p>It may also be viewed from <span class="UIcomponent">My Workspace</span>, in the same folder as the landscape you chose to summarize. You may also view your report outputs in <MadCap:variable name="General.MapStudio" />.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Summary/viewreport.png" alt="summary report is listed with other files for your landscape in MyWorkspace" title="Example of a generated summary report in the MyWorkspace list" class="border" />
        </p>
        <p>Once your summary is created, navigate to <span class="UIcomponent">My Workspace</span>, and view the fire behavior outputs in <MadCap:variable name="General.MapStudio" /> by selecting the "Haypress LF2012 EC - Auto97th" model output file. Use the <span class="UIcomponent">Layer List</span> and <span class="UIcomponent">Zoom</span> to evaluate fire behavior across your landscape. For this example we'll focus on the Sierra City wildland urban interface in the northeast area of the map.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/tutorial_1_comparison/SierraCity.png" alt="mapped landscape with Sierra City highlighted for a closer look" class="border" />
        </p>
        <div class="notificationTip">
            <p>As you evaluate your landscape you may find it helpful to adjust the layer transparency using the <span class="UIcomponent">more options</span> button <img src="../../Resources/Images/ButtonsGeneral/button_moreoptions.png" alt="moreoptionsbutton" /> to the right of your fire behavior layer, and the different <span class="UIcomponent">basemap gallery</span> <img src="../../Resources/Images/MapStudio/overview/button_basemapglry.png" alt="basemap gallery button" />options.</p>
        </div>
        <p>Toggling through the fire behavior attributes of flame length, and canopy fire, we can see some areas north of town, and east between the North Yuba River and some wildland urban interface. These areas could be candidates for treatment. In this example you'll notice the circled areas indicate potentially high flame lengths, rates of spread, active crown fire, and a max spread direction moving north to northeast.</p>

        </p>
        <p>You may also use the <span class="UIcomponent">Landscape Tools</span> <img src="../../Resources/Images/MapStudio/overview/button_landscapetools.png" alt="landscape tools button" class="iftbutton" /> widget to add the landscape file to <MadCap:variable name="General.MapStudio" />, and the <span href="../../10-MapStudio/Functions/Swipe.htm" target="_blank" class="UIcomponent"><a href="../../10-MapStudio/Functions/Swipe.htm" target="_blank">Swipe</a></span> widget <img src="../../Resources/Images/MapStudio/overview/button_slider.png" alt="swipe tool button" class="iftbutton" /> to view the different landscape layers and fire behavior attributes.</p>
        <p>In the next steps, we'll create shapefiles for these areas, then use those shapefiles to specify which part of the landscape to simulate our treatment alternatives for comparison.</p>
