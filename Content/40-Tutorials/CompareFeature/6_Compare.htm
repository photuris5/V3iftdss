        <h1>Simulate a fuels treatments and compare their predicted effect on fire behavior using the Develop Treatment Alternatives task in the Strategic Planning stage of the planning cycle</h1>
        <p>Now that we have some priority treatment areas, we'll evaluate the potential effect of the treatments on fire behavior, using the Strategic Planning stage of the cycle, and the Develop Treatment Alternatives task.</p>
        <p>

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../Resources/Snippets/CompareTreatmentAlts/Introduction.flsnp" />
        <p>We'll progress through each of these steps as you complete this final part of the tutorial.</p>
        <h3>Pick a landscape</h3>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../Resources/Snippets/CompareTreatmentAlts/OriginatingLandscape_part1.flsnp" />
        <p>For this tutorial, select the "Haypress LF2012 Unedited" file we created at the start. Our Existing landscape version of that file will become available during subsequent steps. Next, select "Haypress Treatments All" to constrain the area of interest to the treatment units we created earlier. When we generate reports later, doing this will constrain our report summaries to the area within our treatment area. As we proceed to the edit step, we'll focus solely on creating treatment alternatives; However, if we had not created any files in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />, we could have started here at this <span class="UIcomponent">Pick a landscape</span> step, and use the next step (edit) to both create our existing landscape (Haypress LF2012 EC), and create treatment alternatives from that existing landscape.</p>
        <h3>Edit the landscape</h3>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../Resources/Snippets/CompareTreatmentAlts/Edit_part1.flsnp" />
        <p>For this example we'll use the Default Treatment/Disturbance option to create two treatment alternatives.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>One will simulate the treatment area 2-5 years after a low severity prescribed fire in which less than 25% of the above ground vegetation is killed.</li>
            <li>A second will simulate the treatment area 2-5 years after a heavy thin and pile burn (where the stand is thinned to 35% of its current density by removing material with no upper diameter limit, and the material is burned in piles)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To learn more about the Default rules, visit the <a href="../../30-Tasks/LndscpEdit/TreatmentRuleBackground.htm" target="_blank">Treatment Rule Background Topic</a>.</p>
        <p>For the first treatment alternative we'll look at low severity prescribed fire:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/tutorial_1_comparison/tutorial_default_rule.png" alt="The default editing buttons in the editing interface. Make selections based on the text" style="width: 987px; height: 631px;" class="border" />
        </p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
            <li>Select HaypressCrk LF2012 EC as our starting landscape. </li>
            <li>Use the <span class="UIcomponent">Add Default Fuels Treatment / Disturbance Edit Rule</span> drop-down</li>
            <li> Select a Treatment Type of "Wildland Fire"</li>
            <li>Make sure "low severity" is selected</li>
            <li>For Time Since Treatment, select "2-5 years". </li>
            <li>We'll apply this to the treatment polygons we created earlier, so under <span class="UIcomponent">Apply Landscape Mask</span>, select "Haypress Treatments All"</li>
            <li>Click <span class="UIcomponent">Add to Rules</span></li>
        </ol>
        <p>Now, choose a name for the new landscape:&#160;"HaypressCrk LF2012 EC Rx Low 4yrs" and click <span class="UIcomponent">Save</span></p>
        <p>Next, while still in the edit step, repeat this process, again starting with HaypressCrk LF2012 EC. This time select the "Thin: Slash Removed", "Heavy Thinning:&#160;Pile&#160;Burning" and "2-5 years" since disturbance. Specify the Landscape Mask as "HayPress Treatments All" and add the rule and name the landscape "HaypressCrk LF2012 EC HvyThin 4yrs".</p>
        <p>Next we'll select model inputs to run fire behavior with these treatments</p>
        <h3>Enter model inputs</h3>
        <div class="notificationImportant">
            <p>Once a model is run in Landscape Comparison, it is permanent, there is no way to re-run that model. For this reason, testing out various modeling inputs in <span class="UIcomponent">My Modeling Playground</span> before proceeding with the rest of <span class="UIcomponent">Landscape Comparison </span>is recommended.</p>
        </div>
        <p>You may use any inputs, but for this example we'll use the conditions that were used in the Auto97th summary that we generated in the very beginning of this tutorial, when we created our landscape. To get these, navigate to <span class="UIcomponent">My Modeling Playground</span>. </p>
        <div class="notificationNote">
            <p>Don't worry about losing progress, you can navigate back to the comparison steps later and your data will remain. </p>
        </div>
        <p>Select "HaypressCrk LF2012 EC - Auto97th", and <span class="UIcomponent">View Input</span> from the drop-down. This will take you to a page displaying wind, crown fire inputs, and initial fuel moistures used to model the behavior during the auto97th summary. When you have these values, navigate back to the comparison task and select Haypress as your landscape again. If you wait a couple seconds you will see green checkmarks appear as <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> retrieves the data. </p>
        <div class="notificationNote">
            <p>You may double check this by clicking the <span class="UIcomponent">Run Model</span> tab, which will list all the available landscapes, this should include the two edited treatment alternatives we created.</p>
        </div>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/tutorial_1_comparison/tutorial_modelinputs.png" alt="model inputs as described in text" style="width: 586px; height: 499px;" class="border" />
        </p>
        <p>In <span class="UIcomponent">Model&#160;Input</span>, enter the following values, and click <span class="UIcomponent">Save Inputs</span> when finished.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Wind speed: 20 mph</li>
            <li>Wind Direction:&#160;225 degrees</li>
            <li>Crown Fire Method: Scott/Reinhardt</li>
            <li>Fuel Moisture Content: 100</li>
            <li>Initial Fuel Moistures of</li>
            <li>1 hr FM: 3</li>
            <li>10 hr FM: 4</li>
            <li>100 hr FM: 5</li>
            <li>Herb FM: 119</li>
            <li>Woody FM: 99</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When you save your inputs a verification will appear at the top of the screen to confirm your inputs have been saved</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/treatment_compare/model_input_verification.png" alt="green verification box indicating model inputs have been saved" />
        </p>
        <h3>Run the model for some or all of the edited landscapes</h3>
        <p>Now that we have our inputs, we can run the fire behavior model. For this example we'll run models for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>HaypressCrk LF2012 EC - Our existing condition landscape</li>
            <li>HaypressCrk LF2012 EC Rx Low 4yrs - Our prescribed burn treatment alternative</li>
            <li>HaypressCrk LF2012 EC HvyThin 4yrs - Our heavy thin treatment alternative</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/treatment_compare/comparison_model_list.png" alt="a list of available landscapes for which the fire behavior model may be run" style="width: 809px; height: 274px;" class="border" />
        </p>
        <p>Click <span class="UIcomponent">Run Model </span>next to the three landscaped indicated above</p>
        <div class="notificationTip">
            <p>Note if your last edit landscape is not visible, you may need to click the refresh button <img src="../../Resources/Images/buttons_general/button_refresh.png" alt="Refresh button" /> next to "Landscapes"</p>
        </div>
        <h3>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/treatment_compare/comparison_model_list_verify.png" alt="A green box at the top of the page, and hourglass next to each landscape, indicates the model for each one is running" class="border" />
        </h3>
        <p>A green verification box, and hourglass next to each landscape will let you know the model is running</p>
        <div class="notificationTip">
            <p>It may take a few minutes for the models to run depending on the number of landscapes modeled and their size. You may use the refresh button to the right of <span class="UIcomponent">Run Status</span> to check their progress.</p>
        </div>
        <p>Once the model has completed, you will see a green check mark, and the word "completed" next to each landscape.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/treatment_compare/comparison_model_list_fin.png" alt="green check marks and the word 'completed' next to each landscape indicates the model has finished running for that landscape" class="border" />
        </p>
        <h3>Compare model outputs for your treatment alternatives</h3>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../Resources/Snippets/CompareTreatmentAlts/Comparison_Part1.flsnp" />
        <p>To begin,  select the low severity prescribed fire treatment, which will be tagged with a "1", then our existing landscape, which will be tagged with a "2". The comparison display the difference in landscape features and fire behavior between the two landscapes. When finished, click <span class="UIcomponent">View in Map</span>.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/tutorial_1_comparison/tut_compare_alts_1_2.png" alt="comparison screen with the rows for each landscape described in text are highlighted" class="border" />
        </p>
        <div class="notificationNote">
            <p>Why 2-1? The use of "1" and "2" in the comparison tool is product of how <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> calculates the comparison. For example, if we are interested in the change in flame length between a Treatment and the Existing landscape, we'd select the Treatment first (it gets assigned "1") and the Existing condition landscape second (it gets assigned "2"). <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> calculates landscape change as:</p>
            <p>1-2=landscape change</p>
            <p>For example, if flame lengths in the treated area are 3 feet (landscape “1”) , and flame lengths in the untreated area are 8 feet (landscape “2”), the resulting comparison landscape will show a value of -5, or a reduction in flame length of 5 feet:</p>
            <p>3ft-8ft = -5 ft.</p>
        </div>
        <p>Once <span class="UIcomponent">View on Map</span> is selected, the left side of the screen will show the map interface. You will notice the map contains landscape and model output layers for both the EC and prescribed fire treated landscapes, as well as a layer for model outputs and landscape features indicating the degree of change between each. Specifically, the map will have:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Modeled Output Change:&#160;HaypressCrk LF2012 EC Rx Low 4yrs/HaypressCrk LF2012EC</li>
            <li>Modeled Output: HaypressCrk LF2012 EC&#160;Rx Low 4yrs</li>
            <li>Model Output:&#160;HaypressCrk LF2012EC</li>
            <li>Landscape Change:&#160;HaypressCrk LF2012 EC Rx Low 4yrs/HaypressCrk LF2012EC</li>
            <li>Landscape: HaypressCrk LF2012 EC&#160;Rx Low 4yrs</li>
            <li>Landscape:&#160;HaypressCrk LF2012EC</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/tutorial_1_comparison/tumapcompare.png" alt="map layers showing a decrease in flame length, rate of spread, and crown fire" style="width: 738px; height: 726px;" class="border" />
        </p>
        <p>Looking at the "Model Output Change" layer, we can see flame length and rate of spread both decreased substantially in the treatment areas, and crown fire activity also decreased.</p>
        <p>Using the <span class="UIcomponent">Swipe</span> widget, you can swipe back and forth between layers:</p>
        <p>For example, turn off all layers except the two model outputs for "Modeled Output: HaypressCrk LF2012 EC&#160;Rx Low 4yrs", and </p>
        <p>"Model Output:&#160;HaypressCrk LF2012EC".</p>
        <p>Make sure the same feature in each one is selected (in this case flame length). Select the <span class="UIcomponent">Swipe</span> widget <img src="../../Resources/Images/mapstudio/button_slider.png" alt="swipe tool button" /> in the top right of the map interface. In the widget drop-down, select the EC layer, which will place the EC at the top of the slider (the other layer will be on the bottom).</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/tutorial_1_comparison/tutswipe.png" alt="swiping between two layers in the the map" style="width: 1113px; height: 479px;" class="border" />
        </p>
        <p>As you swipe back and forth you will notice the EC flame lengths in the top portion, and the prescribed layer flame lengths revealed on the bottom portion when swiping back and forth. For details on specific pixels, you may use the <span class="UIcomponent">Identify</span> widget <img src="../../Resources/Images/mapstudio/button_identify.png" alt="identify tool" /> in the top left as well.</p>
        <p>With these same landscapes selected generate a fire behavior summary report, click the <span class="UIcomponent">Compare in Summary Report</span> button. Next to the Fire Behavior Compare Summary Report option, click <span class="UIcomponent">Create Report</span></p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/treatment_compare/summery_report_bttn08012017.png" alt="summery report button" style="width: 1190px; height: 506px;" class="border" />
        </p>
        <p>Because you selected an area of interest when you picked your landscape, this report reflects the changes in fire behavior within that area. Scroll through the comparative bar chart, table, pie chart, and percent difference columns. We scrolling through the report we can see the effects of the landscape treatment, which includes a decrease in flame length (depicted below) and fire spread. </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/treatment_compare/highchart_column080117.png" alt="the column chart indicates flame lengths have decreased" style="width: 909px;height: 447px;" />
        </p>
        <p>You can download the entire report using the download button in the top right, or an individual chart by using the "hamburger" icon in the right of each chart</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/treatment_compare/report_download_08012017.png" style="width: 874px; height: 537px;" class="border" />
        </p>
        <p>Try it yourself! You may also compare the thinning treatment to your Existing Condition landscape, or even the two treated landscapes to each other.</p>
