        <h1>Creating Treatment Polygons</h1>
        <p>To simulate and evaluate the impact of treatments, we'll delineate our planned treatment areas with shapefiles in <MadCap:variable name="General.MapStudio" />. First we will create a polygon for each treatment area, next we will combine those into one shapefile so we can use the combined file in our comparison. </p>
        <p>First, we'll create three individual shape files:</p>
        <p> Open <span class="UIcomponent">Create/Edit Shapes</span><img src="../../Resources/Images/mapstudio/button_editTools.png" alt="create edit shapes button" class="button" /> , select your method, in this case the freehand draw method, and draw your polygon. </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/tutorial_1_comparison/tut1_createshapefile.png" alt="using the freehand draw tool to draw a polygon on the landscape" style="width: 946px;height: 386px;" />
        </p>
        <p>You can use the <span class="UIcomponent">delete button</span> <img src="../../Resources/Images/mapstudio/button_edittools_clear.png" alt="delete button" class="button" /> to remove the polygon before saving, or edit it by single left clicking and moving the vertices. When you are satisfied with your first polygon, give it a name, select a project folder and click <span class="UIcomponent">Create</span>. Once created, polygons will appear on the map in purple. Continue this for the three treatment areas as shown below.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/tutorial_1_comparison/tut1_polygoncloseup.png" alt="a zoomed view of the three treatment pologygons to the north and east of the wui" style="width: 876px; height: 418px;" class="border" />
        </p>
        <div class="notificationNote">
            <p>Note that your polygons do not have be an exact match with ones pictured above.</p>
        </div>
        <p>(<a href="../../10-MapStudio/Functions/EditTools.htm" target="_blank">You may also upload shapefiles if you prefer</a>)</p>
        <p>Repeat this step for two additional treatment areas, similar to those in the image above. </p>
        <p>To combine these into one file, click the <span class="UIcomponent">Copy from Existing Features</span> button <img src="../../Resources/Images/mapstudio/button_copy_exstng_ftrs.png" style="width: 29px; height: 29px;" alt="Copy from Existing Features button" class="button" />, make sure the <span class="UIcomponent">Select multipart</span> option under the button is selected, and left mouse click your first polygon. It will appear highlighted once selected. Continue this process, each time clicking the <span class="UIcomponent">Copy from Existing Features</span> button <img src="../../Resources/Images/mapstudio/button_copy_exstng_ftrs.png" style="width: 29px; height: 29px;" alt="Copy from Existing Features button" class="button" />, and highlighting the next polygon, until all are selected. When finished, give the set a name, specify a folder to save it in (in this case our Haypress Creek Project folder), and click <span class="UIcomponent">Create</span>.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/tutorial_1_comparison/tut1_combineshapefile.png" alt="use Edit/Create Tools options to save multiple polygons in one file" />
        </p>
        <p>Once the new shapefile has been successfully created, you will see 'Shape Created' Appear in  <span class="UIcomponent">Create/Edit Shapes</span>.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/tutorial_1_comparison/tut1_shapeconfirmation.png" alt="Once saved, you will see 'shape created' displayed in the Create/Edit Shapes box" style="width: 272px; height: 224px;" class="border" />
        </p>
        <p>Shapes are available in <span class="UIcomponent">My Workspace </span>in the folder you selected (in this case the Haypress Creek Project folder).</p>
