        <h1>Using FTEM</h1>
        <p>The FTEM interface is arranged to walk you through the process. Use the tabs to select a wildfire, select your treatment areas, enter monitoring data, and review and submit your data. Below, we walk through each stage of this process. The follow steps assume you have an FTEM account (If not, visit the <a href="AccountSetup.htm" target="_blank">FTEM&#160;Setup Topic</a> for instructions). Upon opening FTEM, you will see wildfires with a split view of <MadCap:variable name="General.MapStudio" /> on the left, and a table view on the right.</p>
