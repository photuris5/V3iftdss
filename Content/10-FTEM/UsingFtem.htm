        <h1>How to Use FTEM</h1>
        <p>The FTEM interface is arranged to walk you through the FTEM process. Use the tabs to select a wildfire, select your treatment areas, enter monitoring data, review, and submit your data. Below, we walk through each stage of this process. The following steps assume you have an FTEM account. If not, visit the <a href="AccountSetup.htm" target="_blank">FTEM&#160;Setup Topic</a> for instructions. Upon opening FTEM, you will see wildfires with a split view of <MadCap:variable name="General.MapStudio" /> on the left, and a table view on the right.</p>

                <p>Pick a wildfire based on year and wildfire name:</p>

                    <li>Enter a Wildfire Year, the year the wildfire was declared under control, or extinguished.</li>
                    <li>(Optional) Filter your results by agency. If you are not an administrator or dual agency editor, this option may not be visible.</li>
                    <li>(Optional) Use the wildfire search field to further constrain your results by entering the fire name.</li>
                    <li>Left-click to select the desired fire name from the list.</li>
                    <div class="notificationTip">
                        <p>Need to de-select your fire? Hover over the green checkmark next to the fire name in the tabs along the top. When the checkmark turns into a red x, click the x to de-select your fire.</p>

                    <li>(Optional)&#160;Click the <span class="UIcomponent">Zoom To</span> button to zoom to the fire on the map, or the <span class="UIcomponent">Table Summary</span> button to see a summary of the interactions for that fire.</li>
                    <li>Proceed to the <span class="UIcomponent">Treatments</span> Tab. You may also proceed to Treatments by clicking the<span class="UIcomponent"> Select Treatments</span> button located to the left of the <span class="UIcomponent">Zoom To</span> button.</li>

                <p> In this step you will choose all the treatments for your agency that you know interacted or influenced the fire. Monitoring data for each of these will be added via the Monitoring tab. This step can be thought of as your "shopping cart" where you place the treatments needing monitoring, and remove the ones that don't. </p>

                    <li>(Optional)&#160;If you know there are treatments that interacted with the wildfire, but do not see them here, click the <span class="UIcomponent">Add Treatment(s)</span> button to search and select treatments near the fire (This option allows you to choose a buffer distance to search within).</li>
                    <div class="notificationTip">
                        <p>By using the check box for one or more treatment, you may choose to enter data for treatments individually, or in batches.</p>

                    <li>If there are treatments that did not interact with the fire, use the check box to select them and click the <span class="UIcomponent">Remove Treatment(s)</span> button. If you need to add these back in later, you may do so by using the <span class="UIcomponent">Add Treatments(s)</span> button.</li>
                    <li>Once you have all desired treatments, select them either individually by clicking the check box to the left of the treatment name(s), or by using the <span class="UIcomponent">Select All</span> button. <div class="notificationTip"><p>Note the colored icons to the left of the treatment names. In this example the polygon icons <img src="../Resources/Images/FTEM/symbology/wildfire_poly.png" alt="polgygon" /> indicate these treatments are polygons, and their red color indicates monitoring/data entry for them has not been started.
