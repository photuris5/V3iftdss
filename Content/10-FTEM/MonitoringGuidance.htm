            </MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>This question focuses on the expected changes in fire behavior (intensity, flame length, or rate of spread) when the fuel treatment is tested by a wildfire, that was described in the treatment objectives when the fuel treatment was planned, conducted, and/or completed.  (For example: In forest fuel types the fire behavior went from a crown fire to a surface fire.  Or, in shrub fuel types the fire behavior decreased in flame length or intensity or rate of spread.)</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Answer 'Yes' if changes in fire behavior met treatment objective.</li>
                    <li>Answer 'No' if changes in fire behavior did not meet the treatment objectives, then explain in the Comments field.</li>

            </MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <ul>
                    <li>Answer 'Yes' if the treatment contributed to control/management of the fire. For example: if treatment unit was used as a barrier in a burnout operation, or  used to support field crews by providing an effective retardant dropped, or used to dig hand line, or used to catch the wildfire during initial attack  (before it got big) then the answer would be 'Yes'.  A treatment might also allow for the management of a multiple objective fire, allowing fire to burn through treatment with lower severity or decision maker to decide to manage an unplanned ignition for resource benefits. </li>
                    <li> Answer “No” if the treatment did not contribute to control or management of the fire, for example the wildfire went through the unit because of extreme fire behavior or fire fighters would have been at risk to control the fire.</li>

            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
