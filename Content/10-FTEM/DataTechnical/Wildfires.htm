        <h1>FTEM Wildfire Data</h1>
        <p class="comment" style="font-weight: bold;">UNDER&#160;DEVELOPMENT</p>
        <p>The Fuels Treatment Effectiveness Monitoring (FTEM) process relies on geospatial datasets to depict wildfire locations from participating NWCG agencies, including four land management Agencies within the Department of Interior (National Park Service, Bureau of Land Management, US Fish and Wildlife Service, and Bureau of Indian Affairs) and the Department of Agriculture (USDA Forest Service). These geospatial datasets consist of both point and polygon features. The FTEM wildfire locations datasets are derived from data stored in:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The <a href="https://www.forestsandrangelands.gov/WFIT/applications/IRWIN/index.shtml" target="_blank">Integrated Reporting of Wildland Fire Information  <i class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> (IRWIN) data exchange service. This service provides point locations and fire-related data for fires across the United States.</li>
            <li>The <a href="https://www.geomac.gov/" target="_blank">Geospatial Multi-Agency Coordination  <i class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> (GeoMAC) program. This service provides fire perimeter (polygon) data, where it exists.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/FTEM/integrated_wildfire_data.png" alt="data as described in text" class="border" />
        </p>
        <p>Wildland fire data is first drawn from IRWIN, then from GeoMAC. Next, the data is filtered before being displayed in the application. Details of each process are outlined below.</p>
        <h2>Loading Wildfire Point Data into FTEM</h2>
        <p>Point data is taken from IRWIN which can be thought of as a central hub orchestrating data between the various applications. IRWIN&#160;has interfaces with several systems:&#160;</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Computer-Aided Dispatch (CAD) systems used for managing information during Initial Attack and Extended Attack wildfire management activities at local units.</li>
            <li>The FireCode application used to generate financial codes for wildfires</li>
            <li>The Sit/209 application used to track the status of large or significant fires</li>
            <li>The Wildland Fire Decision Support System (WFDSS), used to support decision making. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>All data for an incident is linked to a single unique ID associated with that unique wildland fire incident. By linking all data for an incident to a single ID, IRWIN is a convenient “one-stop shop” for information on specific fires from many wildland fire computer systems.</p>
        <p>The location for a wildfire in FTEM is based on the fire’s Point of Origin (Origin). The origin location for a wildfire is part of the IRWIN dataset. As the origin location is refined over the life span of an incident, it may change within IRWIN, but each incident only has one Point of Origin value defined at any point in time. IRWIN maintains control over which systems in the data exchange network are “authoritative” for the data that they exchange. Over the life span of a fire, FireCode, CAD, Sit/209, and WFDSS may all update Origin location data. IRWIN allows the most authoritative system at any given time to “win” in the event of a data conflict.</p>
        <p>Final Fire Reporting applications, such as WFMI (BIA, BLM, and NPS), FMIS (FWS) and FireStat (USDA FS) are currently not writing data to IRWIN. As a result, corrections such as “final” size, locations, and in some cases control and out dates, are not available through the IRWIN service. Improvements in IRWIN and other applications, scheduled for the 2019 fire season, are intended to fix this drawback. When Final Fire Reporting applications are added to the IRWIN data exchange environment, they will be designated “most authoritative” for fire location information. Integration with final fire reporting applications in the production environment is expected to take place beginning in 2019.</p>
        <h3>IRWIN Point Data retrieval details</h3>
        <p>Point data is pulled into the FTEM&#160;system nightly from IRWIN to add information that had been entered into the system since the previous pull. Information pulled includes:</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
            <li>Valid (<span class="code">isvalid=1</span>)</li>
            <li>Marked as wild fires <span class="code">(incidenttypecategory ='WF'</span>)</li>
            <li>Have at least one of the three dates not null (control, contain or out date)</li>
            <li>In the case control/out/contain are null, fires not modified in the last 45 days (using ModifiedOnDateTime from IRWIN) are pulled and an FTEM&#160;End Date is assigned.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Once data has been pulled it is added to the FTEM&#160;system:</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
            <li>New fires are added</li>
            <li>Existing fires in FTEM&#160;are updated if a change was made</li>
            <li>An FTEM&#160;end date is generated. The end date is:<ul><li>Minimum between control and out date</li><li>If control or out date are null the contain date is used</li><li><p>If control/countain/out are null 45 days are added to the fire start date and that is used.</p><div class="notificationImportant"><p> The FTEM&#160;End Date is generated for all wildfires, but is only used in situations where a wildfire has no control, contain, or out date specified in IRWIN. The FTEM End Date gets updated in case any of these columns control/out/contain get updated (the update will follow same definition as above)</p></div></li></ul></li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Loading Wildfire Perimeters into FTEM</h2>
        <p>Wildfire perimeters, represented as polygon features, are collected and made available through the GeoMAC program. GeoMAC personnel, using GIS software and automated tools, harvest fire perimeter data from ftp.nifc.gov, the Alaska Fire Service, WFDSS, and the Enterprise Geospatial Portal. These perimeters come from a variety of sources, including trained incident GIS Specialists, Infrared Interpreters, Field Observers, incident operations resources, and agency staff.  Once collected, GeoMAC personnel perform limited QA/QC to remove duplicates and identify the most recent, authoritative perimeter if there are multiple perimeters, and make it available through a web service. GeoMAC personnel also populate the IRWIN ID field for fire perimeters, which allows tabular data from IRWIN to be used with the fire perimeters.</p>
        <h3>GeoMAC Polygon Data retrieval details</h3>
        <p>Data is pulled into the FTEM&#160;system nightly from  GeoMAC for all the perimeters that have the latest flag as Y (<span class="code">latest = ‘Y’</span>). All data with the "Y" flag is pulled and data from the previous pull is discarded. This process is used because of GeoMAC limitations in distinguishing modifications within a given date range.</p>
        <p>Once data has been pulled it is added to the FTEM&#160;system:</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
            <li>Matching fires are identified in the FTEM&#160;database using <span class="code">IRWINID</span> field.</li>
            <li>If a matching fire does not yet a perimeter, the perimeter is added</li>
            <li>If a matching fire has an existing perimeter, it is updated to reflect the most current data.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>GeoMAC Fire Perimeter Data Filtering</h3>
        <p>Wildfires are filtered before becoming visible in FTEM&#160;using the following rules:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The record must have a date-time value for "Contain", "Control", and/or "Out". If no date is available for these, fires that were created more than 45 days ago are accepted.</li>
            <li>The record must have an "Event Kind" of “<span class="code">FI (Fire)</span>” and "Event Category" of “<span class="code">WF (Wildfire)</span>”.</li>
            <li>The record must be valid (<span class="code">IsValid = true</span>).</li>
        </ul>
