        <h1>FTEM Maps and Symbols</h1>
        <p>The FTEM mapping features consist of either points, or polygons. These are color coded to indicate the status of the treatment documentation in FTEM as either completed, in-progress, or not started. Similar symbology is also used when viewing FTEM data as a list. Below we list each of the symbols used in FTEM:</p>
        <h2>Map Symbols</h2>
        <h3>Wildfire Points</h3>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/FTEM/symbology/wildfire_point_monitoringcompleted.png" alt="wildfire point completed" /> Monitoring Completed: All interacting treatments for the land management agency have been completed for the fire. The monitoring will be available in report queries from FTEM reporting.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/FTEM/symbology/wildfire_point_monitoringinprogress.png" alt="wildfire point in progress" /> Monitoring In Progress: Some interacting treatments for the land management agency have been completed for the fire. "Monitoring in Progress will show up for a wildfire until all the required fields are monitored for each intersecting treatment <span class="Emphasis">AND</span> the fire is completed in the <span class="UIcomponent">Complete</span> tab.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/FTEM/symbology/wildfire_point_notstarted.png" alt="wildfire point not started" /> Check for Interactions: The system has auto-detected potential interactions for the fire based on buffering rules for fires.  These potential interactions need to be verified in the <span class="UIcomponent">Treatments</span> tab and monitored, added, or removed.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/FTEM/symbology/wildfire_point_nonselected.png" alt="wildfire point non detected" /> No Interactions Detected: The System did not auto-detect any interactions. If you suspect interactions should be showing, select the wildfire, go to the <span class="UIcomponent">Treatments</span> tab and use the <span class="UIcomponent">Add Treatments</span> button. If your fuels treatments are still not present, ensure they are in your Agency's system of record and contact your <a href="../AgencyLeads.htm" target="_blank">Agency Lead</a> to inquire why they have not been loaded into FTEM.</p>
        <h3>Wildfire Polygons</h3>
        <p> <img src="../../Resources/Images/FTEM/symbology/wildfire_poly_int_complete.png" alt="wildfire polygon treatment complete" /> Monitoring Completed: All interacting treatments for the land management agency have been completed for the fire. The monitoring will be available in report queries from FTEM reporting.</p>
        <p> <img src="../../Resources/Images/FTEM/symbology/wildfire_poly_int_inprogress.png" alt="wildfire poly treatment in progress" /> Monitoring In Progress: Some interacting treatments for the land management agency have been completed for the fire. "Monitoring in Progress will show up for a wildfire until all the required fields are monitored for each intersecting treatment <span class="Emphasis">AND</span> the fire is completed in the <span class="UIcomponent">Complete</span> tab.</p>
        <p> <img src="../../Resources/Images/FTEM/symbology/wildfire_poly_int_notstarted.png" alt="wildfire poly not started" /> Check for Interactions: The system has auto-detected potential interactions for the fire based on buffering rules for fires.  These potential interactions need to be verified in the <span class="UIcomponent">Treatments</span> tab and monitored, added, or removed.</p>
        <p> <img src="../../Resources/Images/FTEM/symbology/wildfire_poly_int_notdetected.png" alt="wildfire poly no interaction detected" /> No Interactions Detected: The system has auto-detected potential interactions for the fire based on buffering rules for fires.  These potential interactions need to be verified in the <span class="UIcomponent">Treatments</span> tab and monitored, added, or removed.</p>
        <h3>Treatment Point Interactions</h3>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/FTEM/symbology/trt_point_int_complete.png" alt="treatment point completed" /> Completed: All required fields have been monitored for the treatment.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/FTEM/symbology/trt_point_int_inprogress.png" alt="treatment point in progress" /> In Progress: Some required fields have been monitored for the treatment.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/FTEM/symbology/trt_point_int_notstarted.png" alt="treatment point not started" /> Not Started: No required fields have been monitored for the treatment.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/FTEM/symbology/trt_point_int_nointeraction.png" alt="treatment point none detected" /> No Interactions Detected: The system did not auto-detect the treatment as interacting with a wildfire.</p>
        <h3>Treatment Polygon Interactions</h3>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/FTEM/symbology/trt_poly_int_complete.png" alt="completed" /> Completed: All required fields have been monitored for the treatment.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/FTEM/symbology/trt_poly_int_inprogress.png" alt="in-progress" /> In Progress: Some required fields have been monitored for the treatment.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/FTEM/symbology/trt_poly_int_notstarted.png" alt="not started" /> Not Started: No required fields have been monitored for the treatment.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/FTEM/symbology/trt_poly_int_nointeraction.png" /> None Detected: The system did not auto-detect the treatment as interacting with a wildfire.</p>
        <h2>Table Symbols</h2>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/FTEM/symbology/ellipsis.png" alt="ellipsis" /> Monitoring for a treatment interaction not started</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/FTEM/symbology/completesymbol.png" alt="monitoring completed" /> Treatment interaction has been monitored.</p>
