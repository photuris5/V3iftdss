        <h1>How to Use FTEM</h1>
        <p>The FTEM interface is arranged to walk you through the FTEM process. Use the tabs to select a wildfire, select your treatment areas, enter monitoring data, review, and submit your data. Below, we walk through each stage of this process. The following steps assume you have an FTEM account. If not, visit the <a href="../AccountsRoles/AccountSetup.htm" target="_blank">FTEM&#160;Setup Topic</a> for instructions. Upon opening FTEM, you will see wildfires with a split view of <MadCap:variable name="General.MapStudio" /> on the left, and a table view on the right.</p>

                    <li>Enter a Wildfire Year, the year the wildfire was declared under control, or extinguished.</li>

                    <li>(Optional) Use the wildfire search field to further constrain your results by entering the fire name.</li>

                <p> In this step you will choose all the treatments for your agency that you know interacted or influenced the fire. Monitoring data for each of these will be added via the Monitoring tab. This step can be thought of as your "shopping cart" where you place the treatments needing monitoring, and remove the ones that don't. </p>
                <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
                    <li>(Optional)&#160;If you know there are treatments that interacted with the wildfire, but do not see them here, click the <span class="UIcomponent">Add Treatment(s)</span> button to search and select treatments near the fire (This option allows you to choose a buffer distance to search within).</li>
                    <div class="notificationTip">
                        <p>By using the check box for one or more treatment, you may choose to enter data for treatments individually, or in batches. Note that when running batches some fields will still need to be revisited and filled individually for each treatment, such as time of burn and acres burned.</p>
                    </div>
                    <li>If there are treatments that did not interact with the fire, use the check box to select them and click the <span class="UIcomponent">Remove Treatment(s)</span> button. If you need to add these back in later, you may do so by using the <span class="UIcomponent">Add Treatments(s)</span> button.</li>
                    <li>Once you have all desired treatments, select them either individually by clicking the check box to the left of the treatment name(s), or by using the <span class="UIcomponent">Select All</span> button. <div class="notificationTip"><p>Note the colored icons to the left of the treatment names. In this example the polygon icons <img src="../../Resources/Images/FTEM/symbology/wildfire_poly.png" alt="polgygon" /> indicate these treatments are polygons, and their red color indicates monitoring/data entry for them has not been started. Learn more about these symbols by visiting the <a href="Symbology.htm" target="_blank">FTEM&#160;Symbology Topic</a>.</p></div></li>
