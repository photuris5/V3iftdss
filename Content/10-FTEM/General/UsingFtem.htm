        <h1>How to Use FTEM</h1>
        <p>The FTEM interface is arranged to walk you through the treatment monitoring process. Use the tabs to select a wildfire, select your treatments, enter monitoring data, and review and complete your monitoring. Below, we walk through each stage of this process. The following steps assume you have an FTEM account. If not, visit the <a href="../AccountsRoles/AccountSetup.htm" target="_blank">FTEM&#160;Setup Topic</a> for instructions. Upon opening FTEM, you will see wildfires with a split view of <MadCap:variable name="General.MapStudio" /> on the left, and a table view on the right.</p>

            <p>Each button and tab in the FTEM&#160;interface is labeled below:</p>

                </p>
                <p>By default, the interface is split, displaying a map on the left, and monitoring tabs on the right. Change the interface at anytime to show only the tabs or only the map by clicking the <span class="UIcomponent">split screen <img src="../../Resources/Images/FTEM/arrowbuttons.png" alt="arrows" class="iftbutton"></img> buttons</span> in the top of the screen just below the top navigation menu.</p>

                    <li>If there are treatments that did not interact with the fire, use the check box to select them and use the <span class="UIcomponent">Remove Treatment(s)</span> button.

                    <li>Once you have all the necessary treatments, select them using the chekboxes, or using the <span class="UIcomponent">Select All</span> button. <div class="notificationTip"><p>Note the colored icons to the left of the treatment names. In this example the polygon icons <img src="../../Resources/Images/FTEM/symbology/wildfire_poly.png" alt="polgygon" /> indicate these treatments are polygons, and their red color indicates monitoring/data entry for them has not been started.
