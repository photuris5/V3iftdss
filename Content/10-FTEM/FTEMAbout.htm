        <h1>About FTEM</h1>
        <p>The Fuel Treatment Effectiveness Monitoring (FTEM) application collects data that documents the effectiveness of fuel treatments on wildland fire behavior when a wildland fire intersects with a previously applied hazardous fuels reduction treatment. The effectiveness of fuel treatment activities directly measures success in protecting firefighters and the public from wildland fire, reduces the loss of structures and investments, and documents the need to continue with the integrated vegetation management program.</p>

                    <img src="../Resources/Images/FTEM/2017-09-12_17-12-57 copy.png" style="width: 366px;height: 302px;float: right;padding-left: 7px;" />FTEM is integrated into the Interagency Fuel Treatment Decision Support System (IFTDSS) application through a single sign on so fuels planners can model landscape fire behavior and record results to FTEM for further analysis and reporting. In addition, this functionality displays  data in a tabular format combined with geospatial mapping capabilities for a broader understanding of the fuels landscape. Fuels planners can develop future and modify existing hazardous fuel treatment prescriptions in order to reduce the fire size, cost, smoke management, and ultimately allow the burned environment to more quickly return to a functioning ecosystem. This integration automates the wildland fire and fuels data feed into one authoritative data source to help ensure data accuracy when reporting to the interagency wildland fire community, the Office of Management &amp; Budget (OMB), the General Accounting Office (GAO), and other federal and public stakeholders.</p>
                <p>If you are a USDA Forest Service employee or contractor, follow these guidelines for submitting FTEM information per Interim Directive 5140-2012-1:</p>
                <p>•	Complete a fuel treatment effectiveness assessment on all wildfires which start in or burn into a fuel treatment area that has been completed within the last 10 years (within last 3 years in the Southern Region and other areas designated by regional foresters.)</p>
                <p>•	Submit all fuel treatment effectiveness assessment reports within 90 days of control of the fire.</p>
                <p>If you are a DOI employee or contractor, follow these guidelines for submitting FTEM information:</p>
                <p>•	Complete a fuel treatment effectiveness assessment on all wildfires which start in or burn into a fuel treatment area that has been completed and reported accomplishment acres in NFPORS from fiscal year (FY) 2003 to present. It is important that, when filling out this form online, that all corresponding Project and Treatment data is consistent with NFPORS.</p>
                <p>•	Submit all fuel treatment effectiveness assessment reports within 90 days of the wildland fire burning into the treatment area.</p>
