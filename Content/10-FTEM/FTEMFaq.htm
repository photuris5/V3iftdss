                <MadCap:dropDownHotspot>Is completing FTEM a requirement or optional?</MadCap:dropDownHotspot>
            </MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p><span class="Emphasis">Requirement</span>. Anytime a wildfire starts in or interacts with a fuel treatment area, policy for all agencies requires that we document the outcome to examine whether the treatment had the desired effect of reduced fire behavior and/or provided opportunities to firefighters for effective management of the wildfire (2017 Interagency Standards for Fire and Fire Aviation Operations “<a href="../41-References/ReferenceList.htm#NWCG2018" target="_blank">Red Book</a>”). The FTEM application provides the framework for documenting these outcomes consistently across agencies in a manner that demonstrates the utility of the Hazardous Fuels Reduction program for all interested entities including, the Departments of Interior and Agriculture, Office of Management and Budget (OMB), Congress, Program Managers, Interest groups, and the public.</p>

                <MadCap:dropDownHotspot>Where is the fuels treatment data coming from?</MadCap:dropDownHotspot>
            </MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>The FTEM process relies on geospatial Integrated Point and Polygon Fuels Treatment Layers that depict completed fuels treatments from four land management Agencies within the Department of Interior (National Park Service, Bureau of Land Management, US Fish and Wildlife Service, and Bureau of Indian Affairs) as well as the US Forest Service. The FTEM Integrated Point and Polygon Fuels Treatment Layers are derived from data stored in:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Hazardous Fuels Reduction (HFR) Module of the National Fire Plan Operations and Reporting System (NFPORS). NFPORS is the national system for tracking fuels accomplishments for all agencies in the Department of Interior.</li>
                    <li>The Forest Service Activity Tracking System (FACTS). FACTS is the official system for tracking U.S. Forest Service fuels accomplishments.</li>
                </ul>

                <MadCap:dropDownHotspot>Where is the Wildfire data coming from?</MadCap:dropDownHotspot>
            </MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>Wildfire point data are imported into FTEM via IRWIN (Integrated Reporting of Wildland-Fire Information), a service that acts as a real time conduit for fire data between the various wildland fire applications. Wildfire perimeter data are pulled from GeoMAC (Geospatial Multi Agency Coordination), an application that is updated daily based upon input from incident intelligence sources. The FTEM&#160;Application is updated daily to incorporate fires reaching controlled status from Integrated Reporting of Wildland-Fire Information (IRWIN)&#160;and GeoMAC.</p>

                <MadCap:dropDownHotspot>How did you determine what treatments potentially interacted with a fire?</MadCap:dropDownHotspot>
            </MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>Within the FTEM application, there exist both point and perimeter wildfires.  A point wildfire contains a the latitude and longitude of the point of origin as well as a size in acres, but contains no other information to define where the fire burned.  A perimeter wildfire contains a shape of the perimeter in addition to the point of origin.</p>
                <p>For wildfires with an associated perimeter, a 500-meter buffer is applied to define the area within which treatments are added to the Treatments tab and highlighted in the map as interactions when a fire is selected.</p>
                <p>For wildfires represented by a point, an algorithm takes the reported acreage and converts that acreage to an ellipse whose length is 1.5 times its width and whose area is equal to the reported size of the fire.  An ellipse was used as it is a better approximation of a fire perimeter, compared to a circle. A circle with a radius of 1.2 times the length of the ellipse is used to define the area within which treatments are added to the Treatments tab and highlighted in the map as interactions when you select a fire.</p>
                <p>If a wildfire is represented by both a point and a perimeter, the FTEM application will use the perimeter buffer regardless of the buffer type,  it is up to the user to determine which treatments to move to the monitor tab within the FTEM application.</p>

                <MadCap:dropDownHotspot>Where does my data go once entered into FTEM?</MadCap:dropDownHotspot>
            </MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>FTEM data is summarized and analyzed at multiple levels and across various scales to demonstrate the utility of the Hazardous Fuels Reduction program for all interested entities including, the Departments of Interior and Agriculture, Office of Management and Budget (OMB), Congress, Program Managers, Interest groups, and the public.</p>

            </MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>There are a few reasons why you may not be seeing the treatment data you are expecting.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The treatment has not been entered into the official system of record for your agency; NFPORS for all Department of Interior agencies and FACTS for the U.S. Forest Service</li>
                    <li>FTEM treatment data has not yet been updated.  FTEM treatment data will be automatically updated from FACTS and NFPORS on a weekly* basis.<div>*After weekly automatic treatment data updates are monitored for success, updates may occur on a daily basis to better integrate with any changes users perform in the systems of record.</div></li>
                    <li>Filtering on FACTS polygon data according to the FTEM business rules for U.S. Forest Service.  FACTS data has been filtered using the following logic:<ul><li>If a point or poly has the same SUID, only display those points or polys with the most recent Actual Completion date.</li><li>If a point or poly has the same SUID and same Actual Completion Date, filter by Treatment Category. The order of priority for treatment categories is 1) Fire, 2) Mechanical, 3) Other, and 4) Preparation for Treatment.</li><li>If a point or poly has the same SUID, same Actual Completion date, and same Treatment Category, filter by Activity Code. The point or poly with the smallest numerical Activity Code will be given priority.</li><li>If a point or poly has the same SUID, same Actual Completion Date, same Treatment Category, and same Activity Code, the data will not be filtered.</li></ul></li>

            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>The only way to correct the treatment data you are seeing in FTEM is to correct the data in the official systems of record for your respective agency; NFPORS for all Department of Interior agencies and FACTS for the U.S. Forest Service.  FTEM treatment data will be automatically updated from these systems on a weekly* basis.</p>
                <p>*After weekly automatic treatment data updates are monitored for success, updates may occur on a daily basis to better integrate with any changes users perform in the systems of record.</p>

        <h2>Using the FTEM System</h2>
        <MadCap:dropDown>
            <MadCap:dropDownHead>
                <MadCap:dropDownHotspot>If I complete monitoring and later need to update or edit, can I do that?</MadCap:dropDownHotspot>
            </MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>A wildfire where FTEM has been completed can be updated or edited.  Once you locate your fire in FTEM, go to the “Complete” tab and select “Amend”.  Provide a simple justification for the change into the pop-up box and you will be able to make any necessary adjustments.</p>
            </MadCap:dropDownBody>
        </MadCap:dropDown>
        <MadCap:dropDown>
            <MadCap:dropDownHead>
                <MadCap:dropDownHotspot>Some of the treatments listed in the Treatments Tab belong to a different unit or subunit, should I remove them?</MadCap:dropDownHotspot>
            </MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>Consult with the other unit or subunit before removing their treatments from the treatment list. When monitoring has been completed on all the treatments in the treatment list, FTEM will notify system administrators that upward reporting can now occur. A wildfire where FTEM has been completed can be amended, but any treatments removed would have to be manually added back in one at a time using the <span class="UIcomponent">Add Treatments</span> button.</p>
            </MadCap:dropDownBody>

                <MadCap:dropDownHotspot>Many of the fires that show fire and treatment interactions for my unit are campfires escapes where less than &lt;0.25 acres burned and the treatment really didn’t contribute to success.  How do I dismiss these types of fires in the application?</MadCap:dropDownHotspot>
            </MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>Currently, the best way to dismiss fires that really do not require FTEM is to remove all the interactions associated with the fire.  The fire will change in the map and in the Wildfire list from red (which that indicates that interactions have been detected and FTEM has not been started yet), to grey (which indicates that no interactions have been detected any interactions).</p>
