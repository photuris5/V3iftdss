        <h2>What Data To Enter</h2>
        <MadCap:dropDown>
            <MadCap:dropDownHead>
                <MadCap:dropDownHotspot>Is completing FTEM a requirement or optional?</MadCap:dropDownHotspot>
            </MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p><span class="Emphasis">Requirement</span>. Anytime a wildfire starts in or interacts with a fuel treatment area, all agencies require that the outcome is documented to examine whether the treatment had the desired effect of reduced fire behavior and/or provided opportunities to firefighters for effective management of the wildfire (2017 Interagency Standards for Fire and Fire Aviation Operations “<a href="../41-References/ReferenceList.htm#NWCG2018" target="_blank">Red Book</a>”). The FTEM application provides the framework for documenting these outcomes consistently across agencies in a manner that demonstrates the utility of the Hazardous Fuels Reduction program for all interested entities including, the Departments of Interior and Agriculture, Office of Management and Budget (OMB), Congress, Program Managers, Interest groups, and the public.</p>

                <MadCap:dropDownHotspot>A treatment for 2018 has already been entered into the legacy FTEM&#160;system, do I need to enter it again here?</MadCap:dropDownHotspot>
            </MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>No. You do not need to re-enter 2018 data into the FTEM new version of <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />, if you have already entered it in the legacy system.</p>

                <MadCap:dropDownHotspot>Was data that had been loaded into FTEM in the years before 2017 included in the new system?</MadCap:dropDownHotspot>
            </MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>Data prior to 2017 is not loaded into the current version of FTEM. If you need to view that data you will have to access the legacy FTEM system and contact the agency lead for FTEM.</p>

            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>Depends on your agency:</p>
                <ul>

        <MadCap:dropDown>
            <MadCap:dropDownHead>
                <MadCap:dropDownHotspot>Can I upload shapes for fires or treatments that are just shown as points?</MadCap:dropDownHotspot>
            </MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>Yes, temporarily. You can <a href="General/AddShapefile.htm" target="_blank">upload shapes for viewing purposes</a> to help you complete your monitoring, the shapes are not retained when you leave the system.</p>
                <p>To permanently add a shapefile for a fire or treatment you'll need to update the systems of record FTEM&#160;uses (FACTS or NFPORS for treatments, IRWIN or GEOMAC for wildfires).</p>

                <MadCap:dropDownHotspot>I don't see a wildfire or treatment I'm looking for, what next?</MadCap:dropDownHotspot>
            </MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>There are a few reasons why you may not be seeing the treatments or wildfire you are expecting.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The treatment or wildfire has not yet been entered into the official system of record for your agency.</li>
                    <li>The treatment or wildfire has been entered into the system of record, but has not yet been captured by FTEM&#160;(data updates nightly).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If neither of the above seem to be the case, you may need to follow up with your FTEM&#160;Agency Administrator to make sure a treatment or wildfire as entered into the system of record. For more details on FTEM&#160;data, see the <a href="DataTechnical/TechDoc.htm" target="_blank">FTEM&#160;Technical Documentation Topic</a>.</p>
                <h3>When wildfires are added to FTEM</h3>
                <p>Fires for the current and the previous fiscal year are pulled based on their containment date, control date, or out date, depending on what data is available in the records. If none of these dates are specified in the records, FTEM assigns a date 45 after the start date. Therefore, some fires may not be visible in FTEM up to 45 days after their start date. For more details see the <a href="DataTechnical/Wildfires.htm" target="_blank">FTEM wildfire Data Topic</a>.</p>

                <MadCap:dropDownHotspot>What if treatments that need monitoring are missing from my treatments list? What if treatments are on the list that don't need monitoring?</MadCap:dropDownHotspot>
            </MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>You can add or remove treatments from the treatment list with the Add or Remove treatment buttons. See the <a href="General/UsingFtem.htm#treatments" target="_blank">treatments section of the FTEM walk-through</a> topic for more detail on this.</p>
                <p>If you have searched and still don't see a treatment in FTEM, you must follow up with your FTEM&#160;Agency Administrator to have the treatment entered into the official system of record (FACTS for USFS and NFPORS for all DOI agencies.</p>

                <MadCap:dropDownHotspot>A wildfire shows up in FTEM as "Check for interactions" (displayed in a red color). I know no treatments interacted or need monitoring, how to I&#160;change the status to No Interactions?</MadCap:dropDownHotspot>
            </MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>If a fire shows up "Check for interactions" (displayed in a red color), but you know it should show up as "No Interactions Detected", you may remove the treatments from the auto-populated treatment list. To do this:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Select the wildfire.</li>
                    <li>Move to the treatments tab.</li>
                    <li>Select all the treatments.</li>
                    <li>Use the <span class="UIcomponent">Remove treatments </span>button to remove them.</li>

            </MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>The wildfire Data is pulled from IRWIN for points and GeoMac for perimeters.  If no perimeter has been loaded in GeoMac for your wildfire, you will only see a point representing it, regardless of the acreage. You can temporarily upload a perimeter for viewing purposes if you have one available (details in this are available in the <a href="General/AddShapefile.htm" target="_blank">Add shapes in FTEM Topic</a>.)</p>
                <p>Please see the <a href="DataTechnical/Wildfires.htm" target="_blank">wildfire Technical Documentation</a> for more detail.</p>
                <p>If you have a wildfire point and would like to view polygon data from your local machine when monitoring, Please see the <a href="General/AddShapefile.htm" target="_blank">FTEM Adding Shapes</a> topic.</p>

                <MadCap:dropDownHotspot>I am responsible for entering data for more than one agency. Can I get access to multiple agencies with one account?</MadCap:dropDownHotspot>
            </MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>Yes. From your FTEM&#160;User Profile you may request access to more than agency role. Each role must be approved by a FTEM Agency Administrator. To see more details see the <a href="AccountsRoles/AccountSetup.htm" target="_blank">drop-down on updating your User Role in the FTEM&#160;Account Topic</a>.</p>

            </MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>For FTEM monitoring, each agency will enter data on their own treatments. If you find it helpful, you may view different agency treatment layers using the Add Layers widget when in the map view.</p>
                <p>For those generating FTEM&#160;reports, the reports for all agencies will be available once the monitoring is completed.</p>

            </MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>wildfire point data are imported into FTEM via IRWIN (Integrated Reporting of Wildland-Fire Information), a service that acts as a real time conduit for fire data between the various wildland fire applications. wildfire perimeter data are pulled from GeoMAC (Geospatial Multi Agency Coordination), an application that is updated daily based upon input from incident intelligence sources. The FTEM&#160;Application is updated daily to incorporate fires reaching controlled status from Integrated Reporting of Wildland-Fire Information (IRWIN)&#160;and GeoMAC.</p>

            </MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>The FTEM process relies on geospatial Integrated Point and Polygon Fuels treatment Layers that depict completed fuels treatments from four land management Agencies within the Department of Interior (National Park Service, Bureau of Land Management, US Fish and Wildlife Service, and Bureau of Indian Affairs) as well as the US Forest Service. The FTEM Integrated Point and Polygon Fuels treatment Layers are derived from data stored in:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Hazardous Fuels Reduction (HFR) Module of the National Fire Plan Operations and Reporting System (NFPORS). NFPORS is the national system for tracking fuels accomplishments for all agencies in the Department of Interior.</li>
                    <li>The Forest Service Activity Tracking System (FACTS). FACTS is the official system for tracking U.S. Forest Service fuels accomplishments.</li>

        <h2>Other Common Questions</h2>
        <MadCap:dropDown>
            <MadCap:dropDownHead>
                <MadCap:dropDownHotspot>If I complete monitoring and later need to update or edit, can I do that? If so, how?</MadCap:dropDownHotspot>
            </MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>A wildfire where FTEM has been completed can be updated or edited.  Once you locate your fire in FTEM, go to the <span class="UIcomponent">Complete</span> tab and select <span class="UIcomponent">Amend</span>.  Provide a simple justification for the change into the pop-up box and you will be able to make any necessary adjustments.</p>

            <MadCap:dropDownHead>
                <MadCap:dropDownHotspot>Some of the treatments listed in the treatments Tab belong to a different unit or subunit, should I remove them?</MadCap:dropDownHotspot>
            </MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>Consult with the other unit or subunit before removing their treatments from the treatment list. When monitoring has been completed on all the treatments in the treatment list, FTEM will notify system administrators that upward reporting can now occur. A wildfire where FTEM has been completed can be amended, but any treatments removed would have to be manually added back in one at a time using the <span class="UIcomponent">Add treatments</span> button.</p>

                <MadCap:dropDownHotspot>Many of the fires that show wildfire/treatment interactions for my unit are wildfires less than &lt;0.25 acres in size and the treatment didn’t necessarily contribute to success.  How do I dismiss these types of fires in the application?</MadCap:dropDownHotspot>
            </MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>Currently, the best way to dismiss fires that really do not require FTEM is to remove all the interactions associated with the fire.  The fire will change in the map and in the wildfire list from red (which that indicates that interactions have been detected and FTEM has not been started yet), to gray (which indicates that no interactions have been detected any interactions).</p>

            </MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>For wildfires with an associated perimeter, any treatment that enters that perimeter is displayed.</p>
                <p>For wildfires represented by a point, a circle with its center at the wildfire’s point of origin is used to determine the potential treatment interactions for a wildfire.  The radius of the circle is based upon calculating the length of an ellipse whose length is 1.5 times its width and whose area is equal to the size of the wildfire.  The radius of the circle equals the length of the ellipse.</p>
                <p>If a wildfire is represented by both a point and a perimeter, the FTEM application will use the perimeter buffer regardless of the buffer type,  it is up to the user to determine which treatments to move to the monitor tab within the FTEM application.</p>

                <p>There are a few reasons why you may not be seeing the treatment data you are expecting.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The treatment has not been entered into the official system of record for your agency; NFPORS for all Department of Interior agencies and FACTS for the U.S. Forest Service</li>
                    <li>FTEM treatment data has not yet been updated.  FTEM treatment data will be automatically updated from FACTS and NFPORS on a nightly basis.</li>
                    <li>Filtering on FACTS polygon data according to the FTEM business rules for U.S. Forest Service.  FACTS data has been filtered using the following logic:<ul><li>If a point or poly has the same SUID, only display those points or polys with the most recent Actual Completion date.</li><li>If a point or poly has the same SUID and same Actual Completion Date, filter by treatment Category. The order of priority for treatment categories is 1) Fire, 2) Mechanical, 3) Other, and 4) Preparation for treatment.</li><li>If a point or poly has the same SUID, same Actual Completion date, and same treatment Category, filter by Activity Code. The point or poly with the smallest numerical Activity Code will be given priority.</li><li>If a point or poly has the same SUID, same Actual Completion Date, same treatment Category, and same Activity Code, the data will not be filtered.</li></ul></li>
