                <p>Data and runs from IFTDSS 2.0 will not be available in this version of <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />. This is because <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />is built on an entirely new system relative to previous versions.</p>

            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>On some runs, FlamMap did not fully complete the modeling run, resulting in partially complete modeling outputs. This is easily seen in Map Studio when a modeling output resembles the one pictured below. The bottom of portion of the map populated with -1 for all output values.</p>

            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>In the Develop Treatment Alternative task, on the "compare" step, horizontal "streaking" sometimes appears in the Landscape Change layer for large landscapes. These streaks do not reflect raster changes, they are introduced due to a re-sampling issues on the ArcGIS server.</p>
                <p><b>Fix:</b> To remove the streaks, zoom in on the map and it will automatically re-draw the layer.</p>

                <p>For landscapes created prior to September 2018: You may notice the blue boundary around  the landscape  does not perfectly match the edge of the landscape. This does not affect your data or use of the landscape in analyses, the boundary simply marks the approximate edge of your landscape.</p>
                <p MadCap:conditions="General.Exclude">This text may be used if IFT-2555 gets implemented. For landscapes created prior to July 2018, you may notice the blue boundary around the landscape does not perfectly match the edge of the landscape. This does not affect your data or use of the landscape in analyses. The issue occurs because the landscape data is generated using a custom Albers projection that is unique to each one, while <MadCap:variable name="General.MapStudio" /> uses a universal projection. As a result, the upper left and lower right corners of the boundary match those of the landscape, but the sides are not an exact match. </p>

            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>In some cases the location may be mapped incorrectly due to Internet Service Provider differences. Sometimes you may be mapped to the physical location of your ISP's servers, sometimes close to your actual location but off by a bit, sometimes nowhere near where you actually are! In short, when GPS is not present and the browser has to rely on your internet connection to determine your location, you are more likely to see the wrong location on the map. This is a known issue that the IFTDSS team is working on, we appreciate your patience while we work through this bug! We are working on eliminating many known bugs, but in the end we are not likely to be able to guarantee that it will work every time on every device and browser.</p>
