        <h1>Additional Resources</h1>
        <p>The following resource list does not directly address <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />, but lists out guidebooks and information sources that are helpful in fuel and fire modeling, as well as geospatial help. Whether your new to the field or just looking for a refresher these resources are worth a look:</p>
        <h2>Geospatial Resources</h2>
        <p><a href="../Resources/pdfs/Resources/ModifyingLF_DataGuide_V1.pdf" style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank">Modifying LANDFIRE Geospatial Data for&#160;Local Applications (Version 1)</a>: A 75 page guidebook which covers LANDFIRE background, the framework for data critique and modification, LANDFIRE approaches and considerations for representing disturbance, vegetation, fuels, fire regime and vegetation departure, along with examples.</p>
        <p><a href="../Resources/pdfs/Resources/RasterPrimer_RDA.pdf" target="_blank" style="font-weight: bold;">Understanding Raster Data</a>: An 8 page primer that defines and explains raster data. </p>
        <h2>Management Resources</h2>
        <p><a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/rm/pubs/rmrs_gtr322.pdf" target="_blank" style="font-weight: bold;">A Field Guide for Selecting the Most Appropriate Treatment in Sagebrush and Pinon-Juniper Ecosystems in the Great Basin <i class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>: A 68 page guide covering key questions, selecting treatment methods and the advantages and disadvantages of those methods, state and transition models, seeding considerations, and selecting treatment areas.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/rm/pubs/rmrs_gtr338.pdf" target="_blank" style="font-weight: bold;">A Field Guide for Rapid Assessment of Post-Wildfire Recovery Potential in Sagebrush and Pinon Juniper Ecosystems in the Great&#160;Basin <i class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>: A 70 page guide covering key questions addressing primary components of resilience and resistance, post-wildfire vegetation treatment assessment, and selecting post-burn areas for seeding.</p>
        <h2>Prescribed Fire Resources</h2>
        <p><a href="https://www.nwcg.gov/sites/default/files/publications/pms484.pdf" target="_blank" style="font-weight: bold;">Interagency Prescribed Fire&#160;Planning and Implementation Procedures Guide <i class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>: Establishes national standards for prescribed fire planning and implementation. These standards describe minimum acceptable procedures, provide clear consistent guidance, prioritize firefighter and public safety, and ensure the incorporation of risk management into planning and implementation.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.nwcg.gov/sites/default/files/publications/pms424.pdf" target="_blank" style="font-weight: bold;">Prescribed Fire Complexity Rating System Guide <i class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>: Establishes interagency prescribed fire complexity analysis standards. These standards provide decision support, identify technical difficulty (complexity), provide a complexity rating system, and identify prescribed fire plan elements.</p>
