        <p>Landscape Editing can occur in both the Landscape Evaluation stage of the Planning Cycle under<span class="UIcomponent"> Landscape Edit</span>, or within the Strategic Planning stage under Develop <span class="UIcomponent">Treatment Alternatives</span>. Menu options and results are the same for both. In editing sessions accessed from the Landscape Evaluation Section, any landscape can be edited. In editing sessions accessed from  the Develop Treatment Alternatives section only certain landscapes may be selected to ensure the comparison between landscapes of the same extent.</p>
