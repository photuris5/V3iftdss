            <p><strong>Important!</strong> Be deliberate in the rules you apply when editing landscapes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Rules are applied based on the order in which you add them. Default Treatment/Disturbance rules are always applied <span class="Emphasis">first</span>, followed by Landscape Edit (User-created) rules.</li>
                <li>
                    <p>If multiple Default Treatment/Disturbance Rules spatially overlap each other the <span class="Emphasis">last</span> (latest) rule is retained, prior Default rules in the same editing session may be ignored. If multiple Landscape Edit (User-created) rules prescribe changes to the same attributes, the <span class="Emphasis">first</span> rule is retained, subsequent rules in the same editing session may be ignored.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>After applying rules to a given landscape you should always validate that your changes have been made as you intended. <span class="Emphasis">If you are unsure of the effect of the rules you apply, consider saving a version of your landscape after each edit to allow for easy comparison of the changes made by each edit rule you apply</span>.</p>
