            <p>If you begin creating editing rules, and navigate away from the edit page without saving, <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> will retain those rules if you return, or begin edits through another part of the system (ie leaving Landscape Evaluation edits and then going into landscape comparison and editing). Partially completed edits will persist until they are saved or deleted.</p>
