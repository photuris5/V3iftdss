The landscape chosen or created in this step initiates your comparison session and will be marked with “0” throughout the workflow.  The “0” indicates the original landscape extracted from LANDFIRE that has not been edited. In subsequent tabs, all landscapes that match this extent will be available for you to work with. In the next tab, the <span class="UIcomponent">Edit Landscape</span> tab, you may edit any of these landscapes. You may use the area of Interest field to constrain your analysis to a specific area within the landscape.</p>
