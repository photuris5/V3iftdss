        <p>A specific attribute for a given cell can only be changed once per editing session. It is the <span class="Emphasis">first</span> edit of an attribute for a cell that affects the change. Subsequent rules that prescribe changes to a cell that has already been changed by a previous rule in the same editing session are  ignored.</p>
