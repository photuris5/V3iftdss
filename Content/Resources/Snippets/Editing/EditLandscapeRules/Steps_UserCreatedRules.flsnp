            <li>Specify the conditions you would like to select in the fields below <span class="UIcomponent">Where these conditions exist</span>. In this example we have selected "Fuel Model" as the Attribute, "is equal to" as the Operator and fire behavior fuel model "165 (TU5)" as the Value. This selected all TU5 fuel modeled areas.</li>
            <li>Specify the conditions you would like to change by populating the fields below <span class="UIcomponent">Modify the following values</span>. In the example pictured here we have selected "Canopy Cover" as the Attribute, "decrease by" as the Operator, and "5" (for 5 percent) as the Value. For all TU5 fuel modeled areas, the application decreases the canopy cover by 5 percent. </li>
            <li>The <span class="UIcomponent">Apply to Landscape Mask</span> (optional) drop-down allows you to constrain your edits to the area within a mask of your choosing. When this field is left blank, the edits are applied to the entire landscape.</li>

            <li>When added, the rule will appear in a list at the top of page, just under the Starting Landscape field, and the order will be noted if you have multiple rules. You can delete rules before saving by using the delete button <img src="../../../Images/ButtonsGeneral/delete.png" alt="delete button" title="Image of the Delete Button"></img> to the right of each rule. Rules are applied top to bottom in the order in which you add them. You may continue to create and apply rules, or name or save your landscape if you are finished.</li>
