                <p>Here you will edit landscapes to develop your Existing Condition (EC) if needed, and your treatment alternatives. The only landscape(s) available to edit at this point will be landscape “0” and any landscapes matching that extent. Create your alternatives by altering your Existing Condition landscape, whether that’s the "0" landscape, an existing landscape that has been made available in this step, or one that you create in this editing step from landscape "0". Whatever the case might be, it is very important to have an Existing Condition to ensure more accurate comparison results to gauge how each alternative does or does not meet objectives. The Existing Condition may need to reflect new disturbances on your landscape, like recent wildfires, fuels treatments, or windfalls.</p>
                <p>The first step in applying a Default Fuel Treatment / Disturbance Edit Rule is to specify the Treatment or Disturbance Type, and when prompted, select intensity or severity of the fuel treatment or disturbance type.</p>
                <p>Next you will select the Time Since Treatment or Disturbance that is most appropriate.</p>
                <p>Lastly you will decide on the extent to which you will apply the rule selected by either selecting a Landscape Mask, which will limit the rule to that shape, or if no Landscape Mask is selected will apply it to the entire landscape.</p>

                <p>Once your rules are selected, give the new edited landscape a descriptive name and select <span class="UIcomponent">Create New Landscape</span>.</p>
                <p>Edited landscapes will be created as new files, this ensures you will always have the original landscape for comparison. You may repeat this process to create your Existing Condition landscape if you need one, and the treatment alternative landscapes.</p>
                <p>Edited landscapes are available in <span class="UIcomponent">My Workspace</span>, stored by default in the same folder as the landscape you are making edits to.</p>

            <p>When clicking on landscape files that have been edited in <span class="UIcomponent">My Workspace</span>, you will see an option to <span class="UIcomponent">View Edit Rules</span>. This displays the edits that were made on that landscape.</p>
