        <h1>Comparing Landscapes to Develop Treatment Alternatives</h1>
        <p class="comment" MadCap:conditions="General.DeveloperNotes">Adding Content JH [UIdaho]</p>
        <p>Develop alternatives to determine how different types of fuels treatments and their spatial arrangement on the landscape affect landscape characteristics and resultant fire behavior. Generate maps and reports to compare landscapes and fire behavior model outputs.  Use outcomes to determine the best fuels management strategy to meet your project objectives.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Select or create an un-edited landscape</li>
            <li>Edit landscape characteristics to create alternative(s)</li>
            <li>Enter fire behavior model inputs</li>
            <li>Run fire behavior models on alternative(s)</li>
            <li>Compare landscape characteristic alternatives and resultant fire behavior outputs on maps and in reports</li>
        </ol>
        <div class="noteIFTDSS" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">All edited landscapes, resultant model run outputs, and comparison reports created in this workflow will be filed in your workspace in the same location as starting landscapes as selected in Step 1.</div>

                <p>Use this tab to create or select a starting, <MadCap:popup><MadCap:popupHead>unedited  landscape</MadCap:popupHead><MadCap:popupBody>Use the report icon to view the Landscape Summary Report for your selected landscape and/or use the globe icon to zoom into your selected landscape on the map
**If you have an Area of Interest that you would like to use to help determine your landscape extent, you can upload it now using the Upload Shapefile tool in the Map Studio
***All landscapes derived from the selected landscape in step 1 will be listed in the Run Model and Compare Alternatives tabs, no matter if they were edited and saved here, in this workflow, or elsewhere in the app.
Note:  Use the extend/retract arrows to either view only the input page, view both the input page and map studio in split screen, or view only the map in the map studio.


</MadCap:popupBody></MadCap:popup>.  The landscape selected in this step initiates your comparison session and will be marked with “0” throughout the workflow.  The “0” notates that it is the original landscape extracted from Landfire and has not been edited. It will be available for you to edit in the <span class="UIcomponent">Edit Landscape </span>tab. If landscape “0” does not represent your Existing Condition (EC) you can edit it to create your existing condition in the Edit Landscape tab.</p>
                <div class="noteImportant" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Important! &lt;/b&gt;">It is important that the landscape you use to develop and compare treatment alternatives mimics, as closely as possible, conditions as they exist on the ground</div>
                <p>If your landscape “0” does represent your EC, you can begin editing to create your treatment alternatives.</p>
                <p>To complete this step either:</p>
                <p>Use the “Select Landscape” drop-down menu to select an existing un-edited landscape from your <MadCap:popup><MadCap:popupHead>workspace</MadCap:popupHead><MadCap:popupBody>All landscapes derived from the selected landscape in step 1 will be listed in the Run Model and Compare Alternatives tabs, no matter if they were edited and saved here, in this workflow, or elsewhere in the app.</MadCap:popupBody></MadCap:popup>, or</p>
                <p>Use the “Create on Map” option to draw a new landscape extent and extract a new Landfire landscape</p>
                <div class="noteIFTDSS" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">Use the extend/retract arrows to either view only the input page, view both the input page and map studio in split screen, or view only the map in the map studio.</div>
            </MadCap:dropDownBody>
        </MadCap:dropDown>
        <MadCap:dropDown>
            <MadCap:dropDownHead>
                <MadCap:dropDownHotspot>Edit Your Landscape</MadCap:dropDownHotspot>
            </MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>Here you will edit landscapes to develop your Existing Condition (EC) and/or treatment alternatives.  The only landscape(s) available to edit at this point will be landscape “0” and all landscapes with the same extent.  You may have produced and edited landscape “0” elsewhere in the application, in which case those edited landscape will also be available as a starting landscape for editing here, in this workflow. If you have not edited and created any landscapes off of landscape “0”, it will be the only landscape available for you to edit.  However, once you edit landscape “0” and click Create, the newly edited landscape will be available as a starting landscape for further editing in the drop down box.  

</p>
                <p>So, if landscape “0”, as selected in the previous step, does not represent conditions as they actually are on the ground, the first thing you will want to do is edit this landscape so it represents your EC.  Choose landscape “0’ in the Starting Landscape drop down and utilize Default Edit Rules or Landscape Edit rules to edit your landscape.  You may need to edit landscape “0” to reflect new disturbances on your landscape, like recent wildfires, fuels treatments, or windfall.  You may also have some local rulesets to apply to your landscape that result in more accurate fire behavior outputs.  Whatever the case might be, this is a very important step to ensure more accurate comparison results to gauge how each alternative does or does not meet objectives.

</p>
                <p>Once you have established your EC, you can use that landscape as your starting landscape and create one to many treatment alternatives to compare.  Steps include:  
</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Select a starting landscape in the Starting Landscape drop down box
</li>
                    <li>Use Default Edit Rules or Landscape Edit Rules and landscape masks (optional) to edit your landscape
</li>
                    <li>Give your edited landscape a unique name in the Edited Landscape box at the bottom of the page.
</li>
                    <li>Click Create New Landscape
</li>
                    <li>Use the refresh button in the Starting Landscape drop down to check to see if your new landscape is available to view
</li>
                    <li>Once your edited landscape has been created, you can choose it in the Starting Landscape drop down to view for accuracy and/or to edit and create a new landscape to compare.

</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Continue in this process to create as many landscapes as needed to compare.  When you are finished editing and creating new landscapes, continue on to the Model Input tab to establish conditions under which the landscapes you just created will be modeled.

</p>
                <div class="noteImportant" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Important! &lt;/b&gt;">It is important that the landscape you use to develop and compare treatment alternatives mimics, as closely as possible, conditions as they exist on the ground</div>

            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>Use this tab to establish the model state by which all landscapes in your comparison session  will be run and compared.  If you are unsure as to what your model state should be for your comparison session, utilize the IFTDSS Playground to test different weather and fuel moisture conditions on your landscape(s).  Creating an Auto97th Landscape Fire Behavior report in the Landscape Evaluation&gt;Landscape Summary portion of the Cycle could also help give you a starting point for establishing model inputs.

</p>
                <p>To complete this step:
</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Type wind speed and wind direction in the “Wind” section
</li>
                    <li>Select Crown Fire Method and type in Foliar Moisture Content in the “Crown Fire Inputs” section
</li>
                    <li>Populate the timelag and herbaceous and woody fuel moisture percentages in the Initial Fuel Moisture section
(Optional) </li>
                    <li>Add rows to establish fuel moistures for individual fuel models</li>
                    <li>Save Inputs
</li>
                </ol>
                <div class="noteIFTDSS" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">You can adjust model inputs even after they have been saved during your session as long as you have not run a model
</div>
                <div class="noteImportant" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Important! &lt;/b&gt;">Once you have run a model in the Run Model tab with saved  inputs, they cannot be modified in this session. </div>
                <div class="noteIFTDSS" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">
If you are unsure what you should use for model inputs, utilize the IFTDSS Playground to test out different weather and fuel moisture condition scenarios and/or the Auto97th Landscape Fire Behavior run and reports in the Landscape Evaluation&gt;Landscape Summary portion of the Cycle.</div>
            </MadCap:dropDownBody>
        </MadCap:dropDown>
        <MadCap:dropDown>
            <MadCap:dropDownHead>
                <MadCap:dropDownHotspot>Run Your Model</MadCap:dropDownHotspot>
            </MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>The Run Model tab provides a space where you can re-name and run models for landscapes you created in the Edit Landscape tab.  The Landscape column in the Run Model table will list landscape “0” as selected in the Pick Landscape tab and all of its derivatives.  Again, as mentioned in previous tabs, landscapes edited off of landscape “0” outside of this workflow will be available here as well.  You can model and compare those landscapes just the same as if you created them within this session.  The Run Name box will be auto populated with the landscape name and the type of model being run.  Currently IFTDSS only runs Landscape Fire Behavior but more models will be integrated soon.  Feel free to accept the default name or rename your model run.  Now you can produce Landscape Fire Behavior for landscapes of your choosing by selecting Run Model after the landscapes you would like to compare.  Use the refresh button to check status.  

</p>
                <p>To complete this step:
</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Click the refresh button next to Landscape in the Run Models table to be sure all of your landscapes are listed
</li>
                    <li>(Optional) Rename model runs for each landscape</li>
                    <li>(Optional)Revisit Model Input tab to be sure <MadCap:popup><MadCap:popupHead>your inputs are as you would like them</MadCap:popupHead><MadCap:popupBody>Once you have run a model in the Run Model tab, the inputs are locked in for this landscape in the Treatment Comparison workflow.  Meaning you will not be able to select landscape “0” and rerun it or any of its derived landscapes with alternative inputs in the Develop Treatment Alternatives workflow.  This is to ensure model outputs that are being compared are commensurate.   We are working on a Modify Inputs option to alleviate this inconvenience. </MadCap:popupBody></MadCap:popup></li>
                    <li>Click Run Model for landscapes you would like to compare
</li>
                    <li>Click the refresh button next to Run Status in the Run Models table to check the status of your model outputs
</li>
                </ol>
            </MadCap:dropDownBody>

                <MadCap:dropDownHotspot>Compare Alternatives</MadCap:dropDownHotspot>
            </MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>The Compare Alternatives tab provides for you a table that lists all of the landscapes that have been edited from the same extent as your landscape “0”, chosen in the Pick Landscape tab, as well as landscape “0”. Model runs created and completed in the Run Model tab will also be listed here.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Use the refresh button next to Landscape in the table to ensure all landscapes and respective model runs are listed</li>
                    <li>
Click on individual landscape or model run names to open the split screen map and view. Note:  Some landscapes and model runs will not be hyperlinked if they have not yet finished processing.  They should become “active” to click and view once they have finished processing
 </li>
                    <li>You can use the checkboxes next to a row to select and then View on Map to view that particular landscape and its outputs

</li>
                </ul>
                <p>To compare:
</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Select two checkboxes next to the rows of the two landscapes and model runs you would like to compare
</li>
                    <li>The first box you check will be tagged with “1” and should represent your “treated” landscape.
</li>
                    <li>The second box you check will be tagged with “2” and should represent landscape/model run you want the first landscape/model run to be compared against, or EC.

</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Example:  My objective is to reduce flame length on my treated landscape.  So, I need to show change due to treatment.  I need my output grid to show that flame length was reduced by treatment.  So, AltA(FL 2)-EC(FL 10)= FL -8.  I reduced my FL by 8.  Grid will show -8 meaning an 8 foot reduction.

</p>
                <p>Once you have checked 2 boxes you can:
</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>View on Map where, if it is not already open, will open the split screen and will display the difference grid for the landscapes you choose.  The layers list should also be open and will list the two landscapes, two model outputs, and two difference grids (landscape diff and model output diff) to view.
</li>
                    <li>Compare in Summary Report where a pop up box will come up for you to select Create Report for either or both of Landscape Compare or Fire Behavior Compare.  Use the refresh button to check status.  Once the report has been created you can click on the blue hyper link opening a new tab where you can view, download or print your report.
</li>
                </ul>
