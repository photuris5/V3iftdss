        <p>Develop alternatives to determine how different types of fuels treatments and their spatial arrangement on the landscape affect landscape characteristics and resultant fire behavior. You may generate maps and reports to compare landscapes and fire behavior model outputs, and use outcomes to determine the best fuels management strategy to meet your project objectives. In this task you will:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Select or create an un-edited (originating) landscape</li>
            <li>Edit landscape characteristics to create alternative(s)</li>
            <li>Enter fire behavior model inputs</li>
            <li>Run fire behavior models on alternative(s)</li>
            <li>Compare landscape characteristic alternatives and resultant fire behavior outputs on maps and in reports</li>
        </ol>
        <div class="notificationNote">
            <p>All edited landscapes, resultant model run outputs, and comparison reports created in this workflow will be filed in your workspace in the same location as landscape you choose in the following step as your originating landscape.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="notificationTip">

The landscape selected in this step initiates your comparison session and will be marked with “0” throughout the workflow.  The “0” indicates the original landscape extracted from LANDFIRE that has not been edited. It will be available for you to edit in the <span class="UIcomponent">Edit Landscape</span>tab. If landscape “0” does not represent your Existing Condition (EC) you can edit it to create your existing condition in the Edit Landscape tab.</p>
                <div class="notificationImportant">
                    <p>The landscape you use to develop and compare treatment alternatives should mimic, as closely as possible, conditions as they exist on the ground, the Existing Condition (EC). When you select your landscape "0", any landscapes that match that extent will become available in the subsequent steps of the Landscape Comparison process. Thus, if you had edited a landscape previously to match the existing condition, choose the original un-edited file, and the edited version will be available in the next steps of Landscape Comparison.</p>
                </div>
                <p>If your landscape “0” does represent your EC, you can begin editing to create your treatment alternatives.</p>
                <p>To complete this step either:</p>
                <p>Use the <span class="UIcomponent">Select Landscape</span> drop-down menu to select an existing un-edited landscape from your workspace or, </p>
                <p>Use the <span class="UIcomponent">Create on Map</span> option to draw a new landscape extent and extract a new Landfire landscape</p>

The only landscape(s) available to edit at this point will be unedited LANDFIRE landscapes (these will be referred to as the “0” landscape) and any landscapes matching that extent. Create your treatment alternatives by altering your EC landscape, whether that’s the "0" landscape, an existing landscape that has been made available in this step, or one that you create in this editing step from landscape "0". </p>
                <div class="notificationImportant">
                    <p>It is very important to have a landscape that represents EC to ensure more accurate comparison results in gauging how each alternative does or does not meet objectives. The EC may need to reflect new disturbances on your landscape, like recent wildfires, fuels treatments, or windfalls. </p>
                </div>
                <p>Once you have established your EC, you can use that landscape as your originating landscape and create as many treatment alternatives as necessary to make your comparisons.  Steps include:

					</li>
                    <li>Give your edited landscape a unique name in the <span class="UIcomponent">Edited Landscape</span> box at the bottom of the page.

                    <li>Use the refresh button in the <span class="UIcomponent">Originating Landscape</span> drop down to check to see if your new landscape is available to view
					</li>
                    <li>Once your edited landscape has been created, you can choose it in the <span class="UIcomponent">Originating Landscape</span> drop down to view for accuracy and/or to edit and create a new landscape to compare.
Use the <span class="UIcomponent">View Split Map</span> button <img src="../Resources/Images/treatment_compare/button_showsplitmap.png" style="width: 41px;height: 24px;" alt="view split map button" /> to view the map output with your edits, if you have not used this setting already.<![CDATA[

                </ol>
                <p>Continue  this process to create as many landscapes as needed to compare.  When you are finished editing and creating new landscapes, continue on to the Model Input tab to establish conditions under which the landscapes you just created will be modeled.
