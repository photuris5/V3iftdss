                    <p>It is important that the landscape you use to develop and compare treatment alternatives mimics, as closely as possible, conditions as they exist on the ground. This ensures more accurate comparison results in gauging how each alternative does or does not meet objectives. The EC may need to reflect new disturbances on your landscape, like recent wildfires, fuels treatments, or windfalls. </p>

                    <p>The use of "1" and "2" in the comparison tool is product of how <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> calculates the comparison. For example, if we are interested in the change in flame length between a Treatment and the Existing landscape, we'd select the Treatment first (it gets assigned "1") and the Existing condition landscape second (it gets assigned "2"). <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> calculates landscape change as:</p>
                    <p>1-2=landscape change</p>
                    <p>For example, if flame lengths in the treated area are 3 feet (landscape “1”) , and flame lengths in the untreated area are 8 feet (landscape “2”), the resulting comparison landscape will show a value of -5, or a reduction in flame length of 5 feet:</p>
                    <p>3ft-8ft = -5 ft.</p>

                <p>When making map comparisons, you will see the landscape and model output for each landscape, and a comparison layer for each, six layers in all:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Modeled Output Change - Landscape "2"/Landscape"1"</li>
                    <li>Modeled Output Landscape "2"</li>
                    <li>Model Output Landscape "1"</li>
                    <li>Landscape Change  - Landscape "2"/Landscape"1"</li>
                    <li>Landscape Features - Landscape "2"</li>
                    <li>Landscape Feature - Landscape "2"</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In the image below we can see changes in flame lengths, heights, and crown fire classes. The cool colors correspond to decreases, as indicated in Layer List.</p>

                </p>
                <p>Using the <span class="UIcomponent">Swipe</span> tool can be helpful to swipe back and forth between layers. Click the <span class="UIcomponent">Swipe</span> tool <img src="../Resources/Images/mapstudio/button_slider.png" alt="swipe tool button" /> in the top right of the map interface. In the tool dropdown the layer you select will be visible on the top part of the slider, the other layer will be visible on the bottom part of the sliders. </p>
                <p>The Swipe tool relies on the features as they are in the layer list, so pay attention to make sure the attributes checked in the layer list are the ones you wish to compare.</p>
                <p>Make sure the same feature in each one is selected (in this case flame length). </p>

                <p>For details on specific pixels, you may use the <span class="UIcomponent">Identify</span> tool <img src="../Resources/Images/mapstudio/button_identify.png" alt="identify tool" /> in the top left as well.</p>
                <p>You may also generate side by side landscape comparison reports using the <span class="UIcomponent">Compare in Summary Report</span> button in Comparison </p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>Summary reports will show bar charts, pie charts, and tables for an entire landscape. These are sell suited for landscape changes, but if you have only small areas of change, the landscape level reports may not indicated a great deal of change.</p>
