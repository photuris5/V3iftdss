                    <p>It is important that the landscape you use to develop and compare treatment alternatives mimics, as closely as possible, conditions as they exist on the ground. This ensures more accurate comparison results in gauging how each alternative does or does not meet objectives. The EC may need to reflect new disturbances on your landscape, like recent wildfires, fuels treatments, or windfalls. </p>

                <div class="notificationNote">

If you are unsure as to what your model state should be for your comparison session, utilize <span class="UIcomponent">My Modeling Playground</span> to test different weather and fuel moisture conditions on your landscape(s).  Creating an <a href="../PCLandscapeEval/Auto97Summary.htm">Auto97th Landscape Fire Behavior report</a> in the <span class="UIcomponent">Landscape Summary</span> task of the <span class="UIcomponent">Landscape Evaluation </span>stage of the planning cycle. can also help give you a starting point for establishing model inputs.

                    <p>Once a model is run in Landscape Comparison, it is permanent, there is no way to re-run that model.

The Landscape column in the Run Model table will list landscape “0” as selected in the <span class="UIcomponent">Pick Landscape</span> tab and all of its derivatives.  Again, as mentioned in previous tabs, landscapes edited off of landscape “0” outside of this workflow will be available here as well.  You can model and compare those landscapes just the same as if you created them within this session.  The Run Name box will be auto populated with the landscape name and the type of model being run.  </p>

                <p> Feel free to accept the default name or rename your model run.  Now you can produce Landscape Fire Behavior for landscapes of your choosing by selecting Run Model after the landscapes you would like to compare.  Use the refresh button to check status.
