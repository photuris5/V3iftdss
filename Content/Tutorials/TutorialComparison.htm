        <h1>Getting Started and Comparing Treatment Alternatives</h1>
        <p>In this hypothetical scenario, we have been tasked with altering LANDFIRE data in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> to reflect the current landscape, and compare the potential effect of two fuel treatment alternatives on fire behavior under 97th percentile weather conditions for the site. </p>
        <p>This tutorial will walk through the steps of creating, evaluating, and comparing fuels treatments on an example landscape. We will assume you have just logged into IFTDSS for the first time, and will proceed through these operations from start to finish. In this tutorial you will:

</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Begin a project</li>
            <li>Create a landscape
</li>
            <li>Evaluate your landscape and edit it to reflect the current conditions on the ground using the Landscape Evaluation stage of the Planning Cycle 
</li>
            <li>Identify a priority treatment area using the Auto97th fire behavior summary and examining wildland urban interface areas in <span class="UIcomponent">Map Studio</span><![CDATA[
]]></li>
            <li>Create treatment polygons in <MadCap:variable name="General.MapStudio" /></li>
            <li>Simulate fuels treatments and compare the predicted effects on fire behavior using the Develop Treatment Alternatives task in the Strategic Planning stage of the planning cycle
.
</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We provide all the information needed to complete this tutorial; However, you may choose to use your own area or files as well.</p>
        <div class="notificationTip">
            <p>If you are unfamiliar with IFTDSS, we recommend watching the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Io7P5A06bT0" target="_blank">4 minute tour</a> to familiarize yourself with how IFTDSS is laid out.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Beginning a Project</h2>
        <p>There is no formal definition of 'project' for <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />, rather, the term refers to all the landscape files, model runs, and associated data for your specific area or project. Before beginning, create a folder for your project in <span class="UIcomponent">My Workspace</span>, to help keep track of your files as they are generated. To create a folder in <span class="UIcomponent">My Workspace</span>:</p>
        <p>Follow the steps below and name your folder:&#160;'Haypress Creek Project'</p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/MyWorkspace/CreateFolder.flsnp" />
        <h2>Create a landscape</h2>
        <p>Landscape in IFTDSS can be created in multiple ways. For example, you could go to <MadCap:variable name="General.MapStudio" /> and create a landscape using <span class="UIcomponent">Landscape Tools</span>. But for this tutorial we’ll create a new landscape by going into the Planning Cycle, Landscape Evaluation, and Landscape Summary. </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Cycle/LandscapeEvaluationSummary.png" alt="Landscape evaluation stage of the planning cycle with the 'landscape summary' task highlighted." style="width: 881px;height: 247px;" />
        </p>
        <p>We can view the landscape in <span class="UIcomponent">My Workspace</span> once its created, but hold off on looking at the landscape summary, because we know we’ll want to make some edits to the landscape for this tutorial.</p>
        <p>We will look at a portion of the Tahoe National Forest located at:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>West: -120.8856 degrees</li>
            <li>East: -120.6044 degrees</li>
            <li>South: 39.4463  degrees</li>
            <li>North: 39.6149  degrees </li>
        </ul>
        <div class="notificationTip">
            <p>To help keep track of your data, we recommend including the LANDFIRE version in the name.</p>
        </div>
        <p>For this example landscape we are about to create, we will name it:&#160;'HaypressCrk LF2012 Unedited'</p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/GenerateLandscape/LCPinInterface.flsnp" />
        <p>If you prefer to create your landscape in <MadCap:variable name="General.MapStudio" />, you may navigate to <MadCap:variable name="General.MapStudio" />, create a landscape using the <span class="UIcomponent">Landscape Tool</span> <img src="../Resources/Images/mapstudio/button_landscapetools.png" alt="landscape tool button" class="button" />, and navigating back to your desired location in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />. Visit the <a href="../MapStudio/Files/LCPCreate.htm" target="_blank">Creating a Landscape Topic</a> for more details on this. </p>
        <div class="notificationTip">
            <p>You can toggle different basemaps (using <span class="UIcomponent">Basemap Gallery</span>) and Reference Layers (using <span class="UIcomponent">Add Reference Layers</span>) in <MadCap:variable name="General.MapStudio" /> to help you locate the area you would like to create a landscape for.</p>
        </div>
        <p>For the next step we'll go back to the Landscape Evaluation stage of the planning cycle and edit using the Landscape Edit Task</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Cycle/LandscapeEvaluationEdit.png" alt="Landscape evaluation stage of the planning cycle with the 'landscape edit' task highlighted" style="width: 1019px;height: 287px;" />
        </p>
        <h2>Evaluate your landscape and edit it to reflects the currents conditions on the ground using the Landscape Evaluation stage of the planning cycle</h2>
        <p>Now that we have our landscape, we can make edits if necessary so it reflects our landscapes existing condition as close as possible. For your own landscape, you’ll have your own editing to do, but for this hypothetical example, we’ll say that we want to reduce the canopy cover in all TU5 areas by 5%.</p>
        <p>proceed through the steps below starting with 'Haypress LF2012 Unedited', and name the newly edited version 'Haypress LF2012 EC' (the EC is short for Existing Condition).</p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/EditLandscapeRules/AddLandscapeEditRule.flsnp" />
        <h2>Identify a priority treatment area using the Auto97th fire behavior summary and examining Wildland Urban Interface Areas in Map Studio</h2>
        <p>To identify the areas that would be good candidates for treatment, we’ll create a summary report using the Auto 97th<a href="../PCLandscapeEval/LandSummaryAbout.htm"> Summary</a>, this will automatically populate a Landscape Fire Behavior model with 97th percentile moisture conditions based on the Remote Automatic Weather Station (RAWS) nearest our area (see <a href="../PCLandscapeEval/Auto97Summary.htm" target="_blank">Auto 97th Technical details</a> for more information on this process). This will generate both a report, and a mapped output. We'll look at the mapped output.</p>
        <p>To begin, go back to the Landscape Evaluation stage of the planning cycle, select the Landscape Summary task:&#160;</p>
        <p>For your Landscape, specify a starting landscape to represent fie behavior on an untreated landscape as it currently exists. For this tutorial, we'll select the Existing Condition landscape we just created:&#160;'HaypressCrkLF2012EC'</p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/LandscapeSummary/GenerateLandscapeSummary.flsnp" />
        <p>Once your summary is created, navigate to <span class="UIcomponent">My Workspace</span>, and view the fire behavior outputs in <MadCap:variable name="General.MapStudio" /> by selecting the 'Haypress LF2012 EC - Auto97th model output file. Use the <span class="UIcomponent">Layer List</span> and <span class="UIcomponent">Zoom</span> to evaluate fire behavior across your landscape. For this example we'll focus on the Sierra City wildand urban interface in the northeast area of the map.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/tutorial_1_comparison/SierraCity.png" alt="mapped landscape with Sierra City highlighted for a closer look" style="width: 694px;height: 624px;" />
        </p>
        <div class="notificationTip">
            <p>As you evaluate your landscape you may find it helpful to adjust the layer transparency using the <span class="UIcomponent">more options</span> button <img src="../Resources/Images/landscapesumm/button_moreoptions.png" alt="moreoptionsbutton" /> to the right of your fire behavior layer, and the different <span class="UIcomponent">basemap gallery</span> <img src="../Resources/Images/mapstudio/button_basemapglry.png" alt="basemap gallery button" />options.</p>
        </div>
        <p>Toggling through the fire behavior attributes of flame length, and canopy fire, we can see some areas north of town, and east between the North Yuba River and some scattered structures that could make good candidates for treatment. In this example you'll notice the circled areas indicate potentially high flame lengths, rates of spread, active crown fire, and a max spread direction moving north to northeast.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/tutorial_1_comparison/SierraCity2.png" alt="possible treatment areas as described in text" style="width: 1184px;height: 590px;" />
        </p>
        <p>You may also use the <span class="UIcomponent">Landscape Tools</span> <img src="../Resources/Images/mapstudio/button_landscapetools.png" alt="landscape tools button" class="button" /> button to add the landscape file to <MadCap:variable name="General.MapStudio" />, and the <span href="../MapStudio/Functions/Swipe.htm" target="_blank" class="UIcomponent"><a href="../MapStudio/Functions/Swipe.htm" target="_blank">Swipe</a></span> tool <img src="../Resources/Images/mapstudio/button_slider.png" alt="swipe tool button" class="button" /> to view the different landscape layers and fire behavior attributes.</p>
        <p>In the next steps, we'll create shapefiles for these areas, then use those shapefiles to specify which part of the landscape to simulate our treatment alternatives for comparison. </p>
        <h2>Creating Treatment Polygons</h2>
        <p>To simulate and evaluate the impact of treatments, we'll delineate our planned treatment areas with shapefiles in <MadCap:variable name="General.MapStudio" />. First we will create a polygon for each treatment area, next we will combine those into one shapefile so we can use the combined file in our comparison. </p>
        <p>First, we'll create three individual shape files:</p>
        <p> Open <span class="UIcomponent">Create/Edit Shapes</span><img src="../Resources/Images/mapstudio/button_editTools.png" alt="create edit shapes button" class="button" /> , select your method, in this case the freehand draw method, and draw your polygon. </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/tutorial_1_comparison/tut1_createshapefile.png" alt="using the freehand draw tool to draw a polygon on the landscape" style="width: 946px;height: 386px;" />
        </p>
        <p>You can use the <span class="UIcomponent">delete button</span> <img src="../Resources/Images/mapstudio/button_edittools_clear.png" alt="delete button" class="button" /> to remove the polygon before saving, or edit it by single left clicking and moving the vertices. When you are satisfied with your first polygon, give it a name, select a project folder and click <span class="UIcomponent">Create</span>. Once created, polygons will appear on the map in purple. Continue this for the three treatment areas as shown below.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/tutorial_1_comparison/tut1_polygoncloseup.png" alt="a zoomed view of the three treatment pologygons to the north and east of the wui" style="width: 876px;height: 418px;" />
        </p>
        <div class="notificationNote">
            <p>Note that your polygons do not have be an exact match with ones pictured above.</p>
        </div>
        <p>(<a href="../MapStudio/Functions/EditTools.htm" target="_blank">You may also upload shapefiles if you prefer</a>)</p>
        <p>Repeat this step for two additional treatment areas, similar to those in the image above. </p>
        <p>To combine these into one file, select the <span class="UIcomponent">Copy from Existing Features</span> button <img src="../Resources/Images/mapstudio/button_copy_exstng_ftrs.png" style="width: 29px; height: 29px;" alt="Copy from Existing Features button" class="button" />, make sure the <span class="UIcomponent">Select multipart</span> option under the button is selected, and left mouse click your first polygon. It will appear highlighted once selected. Continue this process, each time selecting the <span class="UIcomponent">Copy from Existing Features</span> button <img src="../Resources/Images/mapstudio/button_copy_exstng_ftrs.png" style="width: 29px; height: 29px;" alt="Copy from Existing Features button" class="button" />, and highlighting the next polygon, until all are selected. When finished, give the set a name, specify a folder to save it in (in this case our Haypress Crk Project folder), and select <span class="UIcomponent">Create</span>.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/tutorial_1_comparison/tut1_combineshapefile.png" alt="use Edit/Create Tools options to save multiple polygons in one file" />
        </p>
        <p>Once the new shapefile has been successfully created, you will see 'Shape Created' Appear in  <span class="UIcomponent">Create/Edit Shapes</span>.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/tutorial_1_comparison/tut1_shapeconfirmation.png" alt="Once saved, you will see 'shape created' displayed in the Create/Edit Shapes box" style="width: 272px;height: 224px;" />
        </p>
        <p>Shapes are available in <span class="UIcomponent">My Workspace </span>in the folder you selected (in this case the Haypress Creek Project folder).</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/tutorial_1_comparison/tut1_shapesinworkspace.png" alt="a list of shapefiles in My Workspace that we created in the course of this tutorial" />
        </p>
        <h2>Simulate a fuels treatments and compare their predicted effect on fire behavior using the Develop Treatment Alternatives task in the Strategic Planning stage of the planning cycle</h2>
        <p>Now that we have some priority treatment areas, we'll evaluate the potential effect of the treatments on fire behavior, using the Strategic Planning stage of the cycle, and the Develop Treatment Alternatives task.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Cycle/StrategicPlanningCompare.png" alt="treatment alternative comparison task of the strategic planning phase of the cycle" style="width: 780px;height: 191px;" />
        </p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/CompareTreatmentAlts/Introduction.flsnp" />
        <p>We'll progress through each of these steps as you complete this final part of the tutorial.</p>
        <h3>Pick a landscape</h3>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/CompareTreatmentAlts/OriginatingLandscape_part1.flsnp" />
        <p>For this tutorial, select the 'Haypress LF2012 Unedited' file we created at the start. Our Existing landscape version of that file will become available during subsequent steps. As we proceed to the edit step, we'll focus solely on creating treatment alternatives; However, if we had not created any files in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />, we could have started here at this <span class="UIcomponent">Pick a landscape</span> step, and use the next step (edit) to both create our existing landscape (Haypress LF2012 EC), and create treatment alternatives from that existing landscape.</p>
        <h3>Edit the landscape</h3>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/CompareTreatmentAlts/Edit_part1.flsnp" />
        <p>For this example we'll use the Default Treatment/Disturbance option to create two treatment alternatives.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>One will simulate the treatment area 2-5 years after a low severity prescribed fire in which less than 25% of the above ground vegetation is killed.</li>
            <li>A second will simulate the treatment area 2-5 years after a heavy thin and pile burn (where the stand is thinned to 35% of its current density by removing material with no upper diameter limit, and the material is burned in piles)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To learn more about the Default rules, visit the <a href="../PCLandscapeEval/TreatmentRuleBackground.htm" target="_blank">Treatment Rule Background Topic</a>.</p>
        <p>For the first treatment alternative we'll look at low severity prescribed fire:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/tutorial_1_comparison/tutorial_default_rule.png" alt="The default editing buttons in the editing interface. Make selections based on the text" style="width: 745px;height: 638px;" />
        </p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
            <li>Select HaypressCrk LF2012 EC as our starting landscape. </li>
            <li>Use the <span class="UIcomponent">Add Default Fuels Treatment / Disturbance Edit Rule</span> dropdown</li>
            <li> Select a Treatment Type of 'Wildland Fire'</li>
            <li>Make sure 'low severity' is selected</li>
            <li>For Time Since Treatment, select '2-5 years'. </li>
            <li>We'll apply this to the treatment polygons we created earlier, so under <span class="UIcomponent">Apply Landscape Mask</span>, select 'Haypress Treatments All'</li>
            <li>Select <span class="UIcomponent">Add to Rules</span></li>
        </ol>
        <p>Select a name for the new landscape:&#160;'HaypressCrk LF2012 EC Rx Low 4yrs' and select <span class="UIcomponent">Save new Landscape</span></p>
        <p>Next, while still in the edit step, repeat this process, again starting with HaypressCrk LF2012 EC. This time select the 'Thin: Slash Removed', 'Heavy Thinning:&#160;Pile&#160;Burning' and '2-5 years' since disturbance. Add the rule and name the landscape 'HaypressCrk LF2012 EC HvyThin 4yrs'.</p>
        <p>Next we'll select model inputs to run fire behavior with these treatments</p>
        <h3>Enter model inputs</h3>
        <p>You may use any inputs, but for this example we'll use the conditions that were used in the Auto97th summary that we generated in the very beginning of this tutorial, when we created our landscape. To get these, navigate to <span class="UIcomponent">My Modeling Playground</span>. </p>
        <div class="notificationNote">
            <p>Don't worry about losing progress, you can navigate back to the comparison steps later and your data will remain. </p>
        </div>
        <p>Select 'HaypressCrk LF2012 EC - Auto97th', and <span class="UIcomponent">View Input</span> from the dropdown. This will take you to a page displaying wind, crown fire inputs, and initial fuel moistures used to model the behavior during the auto97th summary. When you have these values, navigate back to the comparison task and select Haypress as your landscape again. If you wait a couple seconds you will see green checkmarks appear as <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> retrieves the data. </p>
        <div class="notificationNote">
            <p>You may double check this by clicking the <span class="UIcomponent">Run Model</span> tab, which will list all the available landscapes, this should include the two edited treatment alternatives we created.</p>
        </div>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/tutorial_1_comparison/tutorial_modelinputs.png" alt="model inputs as described in text" style="width: 586px;height: 499px;" />
        </p>
        <p>In <span class="UIcomponent">Model&#160;Input</span>, enter the following values, and select <span class="UIcomponent">Save Inputs</span> when finished.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Wind speed: 20 mph</li>
            <li>Wind Direction:&#160;225 degrees</li>
            <li>Crown Fire Method: Scott/Reinhardt</li>
            <li>Fuel Moisture Content: 100</li>
            <li>Initial Fuel Moistures of</li>
            <li>1 hr 3</li>
            <li>10 hr 4</li>
            <li>100 hr 5</li>
            <li>Herb 119</li>
            <li>Woody 99</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When you save your inputs a verification will appear at the top of the screen to confirm your inputs have been saved</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/treatment_compare/model_input_verification.png" alt="green verification box indicating model inputs have been saved" />
        </p>
        <h3>Run the model for some or all of the edited landscapes</h3>
        <p>Now that we have our inputs, we can run the fire behavior model. For this example we'll run models for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>HaypressCrk LF2012 EC - Our existing condition landscape</li>
            <li>HaypressCrk LF2012 EC Rx Low 4yrs - Our prescribed burn treatment alternative</li>
            <li>HaypressCrk LF2012 EC HvyThin 4yrs - Our heavy thin treatment alternative</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/treatment_compare/comparison_model_list.png" alt="a list of available landscapes for which the fire behavior model may be run" style="width: 809px;height: 274px;" />
        </p>
        <p>Select <span class="UIcomponent">Run Model </span>next to the three landscaped indicated above</p>
        <h3>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/treatment_compare/comparison_model_list_verify.png" alt="A green box at the top of the page, and hourglass next to each landscape, indicates the model for each one is running" />
        </h3>
        <p>A green verification box, and hourglass next to each landscape will let you know the model is running</p>
        <div class="notificationTip">
            <p>It may take a few minutes for the models to run depending on the number of landscapes modeled and their size. You may use the refresh button to the right of <span class="UIcomponent">Run Status</span> to check their progress.</p>
        </div>
        <p>Once the model has completed, you will see a green check mark, and the word 'completed' next to each landscape.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/treatment_compare/comparison_model_list_fin.png" alt="green check marks and the word 'completed' next to each landscape indicates the model has finished running for that landscape" />
        </p>
        <h3>Compare model outputs for your treatment alternatives</h3>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/CompareTreatmentAlts/Comparison_Part1.flsnp" />
        <p>To begin,  select the low severity prescribed fire treatment, which will be tagged with a "1", then our existing landscape, which will be tagged with a "2". The comparison display the difference in landscape features and fire behavior between the two landscapes. When finished, select <span class="UIcomponent">View in Map</span>.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/tutorial_1_comparison/tut_compare_alts_1_2.png" alt="comparison screen with the rows for each landscape described in text are highlighted" style="width: 834px;height: 302px;" />
        </p>
        <p>Once <span class="UIcomponent">View on Map</span> is selected, the left side of the screen will show the map interface. You will notice the map contains landscape and model output layers for both the EC and prescribed fire treated landscapes, as well as a layer for model outputs and landscape features indicating the degree of change between each. Specifically, the map will have:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Modeled Output Change:&#160;HaypressCrk LF2012 EC Rx Low 4yrs/HaypressCrk LF2012EC</li>
            <li>Modeled Output: HaypressCrk LF2012 EC&#160;Rx Low 4yrs</li>
            <li>Model Output:&#160;HaypressCrk LF2012EC</li>
            <li>Landscape Change:&#160;HaypressCrk LF2012 EC Rx Low 4yrs/HaypressCrk LF2012EC</li>
            <li>Landscape: HaypressCrk LF2012 EC&#160;Rx Low 4yrs</li>
            <li>Landscape:&#160;HaypressCrk LF2012EC</li>

        </p>
        <p>Looking at the 'Model Output Change' layer, we can see flame length and rate of spread both decreased substantially in the treatment areas, and crown fire activity also decreased.</p>
        <p>Using the <span class="UIcomponent">Swipe</span> tool, you can swipe back and forth between layers:</p>
        <p>For example, turn off all layers except the two model outputs for 'Modeled Output: HaypressCrk LF2012 EC&#160;Rx Low 4yrs', and </p>
        <p>'Model Output:&#160;HaypressCrk LF2012EC'.</p>
        <p>Make sure the same feature in each one is selected (in this case flame length). Select the <span class="UIcomponent">Swipe</span> tool <img src="../Resources/Images/mapstudio/button_slider.png" alt="swipe tool button" /> in the top right of the map interface. In the tool dropdown, select the EC layer, which will place the EC at the top of the slider (the other layer will be on the bottom).</p>

        </p>
        <p>As you swipe back and forth you will notice the EC flame lengths in the top portion, and the prescribed layer flame lengths revealed on the bottom portion when swiping back and forth. For details on specific pixels, you may use the <span class="UIcomponent">Identify</span> tool <img src="../Resources/Images/mapstudio/button_identify.png" alt="identify tool" /> in the top left as well.</p>
        <p>Try it yourself.... You can revisit the comparison tool and compare the Thinned modeled landscape with the existing condition landscape. The two treatments can also be compared.</p>
        <p>You may also generate side by side landscape comparison reports using the <span class="UIcomponent">Compare in Summary Report</span> button</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/tutorial_1_comparison/tutsummaryreport.png" alt="charts copared side by side displaying fire behavior model outputs" style="width: 853px;height: 393px;" />
        </p>
        <p>Summary reports will show bar charts, pie charts, and tables. </p>
        <p>Because only a small portion of the landscape was changed in this tutorial (within the treatment polygon), these landscape level reports will not indicate a great deal of change.</p>
