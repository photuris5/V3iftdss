        <h1>Getting Started and Comparing Treatment Alternatives</h1>
        <p>In this hypothetical scenario, you have been tasked with altering LANDFIRE data in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> to reflect your landscape, and compare the potential effect of two fuel treatment alternatives on fire behavior under 97th percentile weather conditions for your site. </p>
        <p>This tutorial will walk through the steps of creating, evaluating, and comparing fuels treatments on an example landscape. We will assume you have just logged into IFTDSS for the first time, and will proceed through these operations from start to finish. In this tutorial you will:

</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Begin a project</li>
            <li>Create a landscape
</li>
            <li>Evaluate your landscape and edit it to reflects the currents conditions on the ground using the Landscape Evaluation stage of the planning cycle 
</li>
            <li>Identify a priority treatment area using the Auto97th fire behavior summary and examining wildland urban interface areas in <span class="UIcomponent">Map Studio</span><![CDATA[
]]></li>
            <li>Create treatment polygon in <MadCap:variable name="General.MapStudio" /></li>
            <li>Simulate a fuels treatments and compare their predicted effect on fire behavior using the Develop Treatment Alternatives task in the Strategic Planning stage of the planning cycle
.
</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We provide all the information needed to complete this tutorial; However, you may choose to use your own area or files as well.</p>
        <div class="notificationTip">
            <p>If you are unfamiliar with IFTDSS, we recommend watching the 4 minute tour to familiarize yourself with how IFTDSS is laid out.</p>

        <h2>Beginning a Project</h2>
        <p>There is no formal definition of 'project' for <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />, rather, the term refers to all the landscape files, model runs, and associated data for your specific area or project. Before beginning, create a folder for your project in <span class="UIcomponent">My Workspace</span>, to help keep track of your files as they are generated. To create a folder in <span class="UIcomponent">My Workspace</span>:</p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/MyWorkspace/CreateFolder.flsnp" />
        <h2>Create a landscape</h2>
        <p>You can create a landscape in IFTDSS in multiple ways. For example, you could go right to <MadCap:variable name="General.MapStudio" /> and create a landscape using the Landscape Tools. But for this tutorial we’ll create a new landscape by going into the Planning Cycle, Landscape Evaluation, and Landscape Summary. </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Cycle/LandscapeEvaluationSummary.png" alt="Landscape evaluation stage of the planning cycle with the 'landscape summary' task highlighted." style="width: 881px;height: 247px;" />
        </p>
        <p>On created we can view the landscape, but hold off on looking at the landscape summary, because we know we’ll want to make some edits to the landscape for this tutorial.</p>
        <p>We will look at a portion of the Tahoe National Forest located at:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>West: -120.8856 degrees</li>
            <li>East: -120.6044 degrees</li>
            <li>South: 39.4463  degrees</li>
            <li>North: 39.6149  degrees </li>
        </ul>
        <div class="notificationTip">
            <p>To help keep track of your data, we recommend including the landfire version in the name. For the example landscape we are about to create, we will name it:&#160;'HaypressCrk LF2012 Unedited'</p>
        </div>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/GenerateLandscape/LCPinInterface.flsnp" />
        <p>If you prefer to create your landscape in <MadCap:variable name="General.MapStudio" />, you may navigate to <MadCap:variable name="General.MapStudio" />, create a landscape using the <span class="UIcomponent">Landscape Tool</span> <img src="../Resources/Images/mapstudio/button_landscapetools.png" alt="landscape tool button" />, and navigating back to your desired location in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />. Visit the <a href="../MapStudio/Files/LCPCreate.htm" target="_blank">Creating a Landscape Topic</a> for more details on this. </p>
        <div class="notificationTip">
            <p>You can toggle different basemaps (using Basemap Gallery) and Reference Layers (using Add Reference Layers) in Map Studio to help you locate the area you would like to create a landscape for.</p>
        </div>
        <p>For the next step we'll go back to the Landscape Evaluation stage of the planning cycle and edit using the Landscape Edit Task</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Cycle/LandscapeEvaluationEdit.png" alt="Landscape evaluation stage of the planning cycle with the 'landscape edit' task highlighted" style="width: 1019px;height: 287px;" />
        </p>
        <h2>Evaluate your landscape and edit it to reflects the currents conditions on the ground using the Landscape Evaluation stage of the planning cycle</h2>
        <p>Now that we have our landscape, we can make edits if necessary so that reflects our landscapes existing condition as close as possible. For your own landscape, you’ll have your own editing to do, but for this hypothetical example, we’ll say that we want to reduce the canopy cover in all TU5 areas by 5%, and name the newly edited landscape 'HaypressCrk LF2012 EC' (the EC is short for Existing Condition):&#160;</p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/EditLandscapeRules/AddLandscapeEditRule.flsnp" />
        <h2>Identify a priority treatment area using the Auto97th fire behavior summary and examining Wildland Urban Interface Areas in Map Studio</h2>
        <p>To identify the areas that would be good candidates for treatment, we’ll create a summary report using the Auto 97th<a href="../PCLandscapeEval/LandSummaryAbout.htm"> Summary</a>, this will automatically populate a Landscape Fire Behavior model with 97th percentile moisture conditions based on the Remote Automatic Weather Station (RAWS) nearest our area. This will generate both a report, and a mapped output. We'll look at the mapped output.</p>
        <p>To begin, go back to the Landscape Evaluation stage of the planning cycle, select the Landscape Summary task:&#160;</p>
        <p>For your Landscape, specify a starting landscape to represent fie bahavior on an untreated landscape as it currently exists. For this tutorial, we'll select the Existing Condition landscape we just created:&#160;'HaypressCrkLF2012EC'</p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/LandscapeSummary/GenerateLandscapeSummary.flsnp" />
        <p>Once your summary is created, navigate to <span class="UIcomponent">My Workspace</span>, and view the fire behavior outputs in <MadCap:variable name="General.MapStudio" /> by selecting the 'Haypress LF2012 EC - Auto97th model output file. Use the <span class="UIcomponent">Layer List</span> and <span class="UIcomponent">Zoom</span> to evaluate fire behavior across your landscape. For this example we'll focus on the Sierra City wildand urban interface in the northeast area of the map.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/landscapesumm/SierraCity.png" alt="mapped landscape with Sierra City highlighted for a closer look" style="width: 694px;height: 624px;" />
        </p>
        <div class="notificationTip">
            <p>As you evaluate your landscape you may find it helpful to adjust the layer transparency using the <span class="UIcomponent">more options</span> button <img src="../Resources/Images/landscapesumm/button_moreoptions.png" alt="moreoptionsbutton" /> to the right of your fire behavior layer, and the different <span class="UIcomponent">basemap gallery</span> <img src="../Resources/Images/mapstudio/button_basemapglry.png" alt="basemap gallery button" />options.</p>
        </div>
        <p>Toggling through the fire behavior attributes of flame length, and canopy fire, we can see some areas north of town, and east between the North Yuba River and some scattered structures that could make good candidates for treatment. In this example you'll notice the circled areas indicate potentially high flame lengths, rates of spread, active crown fire, and a max spread direction moving north to northeast.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/landscapesumm/SierraCity2.png" alt="possible treatment areas as described in text" style="width: 1184px;height: 590px;" />
        </p>
        <p>You may also use the <span class="UIcomponent">Landscape Tools</span> <img src="../Resources/Images/mapstudio/button_landscapetools.png" alt="landscape tools button" /> button to add the landscape file to <MadCap:variable name="General.MapStudio" />, and the <span href="../MapStudio/Functions/Swipe.htm" target="_blank" class="UIcomponent"><a href="../MapStudio/Functions/Swipe.htm" target="_blank">Swipe</a></span> tool <img src="../Resources/Images/mapstudio/button_slider.png" alt="swipe tool button" /> to view the different layers.</p>
        <p>In the next steps, we'll create shapefiles for these areas, then use those shapefiles to specify which part of the landscape to simulate our treatment alternatives for comparison. </p>
        <h2>Creating Treatment Polygons</h2>
        <p>To simulate and evaluate the impact of treatments, we'll delineate our planned treatment areas with shapefiles in <MadCap:variable name="General.MapStudio" />. First we will create a polygon for each treatment area, next we will combine those into one shapefile so we can use the combined file in our comparison. </p>
        <p>First, we'll create three individual shape files:</p>
        <p> Open <span class="UIcomponent">Create/Edit Shapes</span><img src="../Resources/Images/mapstudio/button_editTools.png" alt="create edit shapes button" /> , select your method, in this case the freehand draw method, and draw your polygon. </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/landscapesumm/tut1_createshapefile.png" alt="using the freehand draw tool to draw a polygon on the landscape" style="width: 946px;height: 386px;" />
        </p>
        <p>You can use the delete button to get rid of the polygon before saving, or edit it by single left clicking and moving the vertices. When you are satisfied with your first polygon, give it a name, select a project folder and click <span class="UIcomponent">Create</span>. Once created, polygons will appear on the map in purple. Continue this for the three treatment areas as shown below.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/landscapesumm/tut1_polygoncloseup.png" alt="a zoomed view of the three treatment pologygons to the north and east of the wui" style="width: 876px;height: 418px;" />
        </p>
        <div class="notificationNote">
            <p>Note that your polygons do not be an exact match with ones pictured above.</p>
        </div>
        <p>(<a href="../MapStudio/Functions/EditTools.htm" target="_blank">You may also upload shapefiles if you prefer</a>)</p>
        <p>Repeat this step for two additional treatment areas, similar to those in the image above. </p>
        <p>To combine these into one file, select the <span class="UIcomponent">Copy from Existing Features</span> button <img src="../Resources/Images/mapstudio/button_copy_exstng_ftrs.png" style="width: 29px;height: 29px;" alt="Copy from Existing Features button" />, make sure the <span class="UIcomponent">Select multipart</span> option under the button is selected, and left mouse click your first polygon. It will appear highlighted once selected. Continue this process, each time selecting the <span class="UIcomponent">Copy from Existing Features</span> button <img src="../Resources/Images/mapstudio/button_copy_exstng_ftrs.png" style="width: 29px;height: 29px;" alt="Copy from Existing Features button" />, and highlighting the next polygon, until all are selected. When finished, give the set a name, specify a folder to save it in (in this case our Haypress Crk Project folder), and select <span class="UIcomponent">Create</span>.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/landscapesumm/tut1_combineshapefile.png" alt="use Edit/Create Tools options to save multiple polygons in one file" />
        </p>
        <p>Once the new shapefile has been successfully created, you will see 'Shape Created' Appear in  <span class="UIcomponent">Create/Edit Shapes</span>.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/landscapesumm/tut1_shapeconfirmation.png" alt="Once saved, you will see 'shape created' displayed in the Create/Edit Shapes box" />
        </p>
        <p>Shapes are available in <span class="UIcomponent">My Workspace </span>in the folder you selected (in this case the Haypress Creek Project folder).</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/landscapesumm/tut1_shapesinworkspace.png" alt="a list of shapefiles in My Workspace that we created in the course of this tutorial" />
