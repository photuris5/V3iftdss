                <h1>Getting Started and Comparing Treatment Alternatives</h1>
                <p>In this hypothetical scenario, we have been tasked with altering LANDFIRE data in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> to reflect the current landscape, and compare the potential effect of two fuel treatment alternatives on fire behavior under 97th percentile weather conditions for the site. </p>
                <p>This tutorial will walk through the steps of creating, evaluating, and comparing fuels treatments on an example landscape. We will assume you have just logged into IFTDSS for the first time, and will proceed through these operations from start to finish. Work through In this tutorial you will:</p>
