        <h1>Writing and image style</h1>
        <p>In the <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> help you will see content written in second person, for a casual tone. </p>
        <p>Most images are in line, or floated right, depending on what appears better on the page. </p>
        <p>Images typically have labels, shapes or arrows, in red, and 1 px black border (added in Snagit)</p>

                <p>drop-downs have been used in many areas where heading2 would have been used in the IFTDSS 2.0 Help, to offer a lot of material on one page, but in a way that can be summarized at a glance. This was a handy approach for the 'about' pages. Help pages whose file names end in 'about' and are linked to the IFTDSS application. They appear short initially, you can expand the drop-downs to view additional content as needed.</p>
