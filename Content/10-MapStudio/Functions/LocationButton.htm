        <p>My Location, located on the left side of the map, zooms the map in to 0.4 mile extent at your current location. </p>
        <p>In some cases the location may be mapped incorrectly due to Internet Service Provider differences. </p>
        <div class="notificationNote">
            <p>Sometimes you may be mapped to the physical location of your ISP's servers, sometimes close to your actual location but off by a bit, sometimes nowhere near where you actually are! In short, when GPS is not present and the browser has to rely on your internet connection to determine your location, you are more likely to see the wrong location on the map. This is a known issue that the IFTDSS team is working on, we appreciate your patience while we work through this bug! We are working on eliminating many known bugs, but in the end we are not likely to be able to guarantee that it will work every time on every device and browser.</p>
