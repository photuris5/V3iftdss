        <h1>Here is What's <MadCap:keyword term="News" />New in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /></h1>
        <p><b style="color: #8b0000;">New Version!</b> In 2017 the development team released the latest version of <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />. If you are a returning <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> user, you may notice there are less models currently available in the interface. This is because much of the efforts in this release have gone on behind the scenes to update the architecture and foundation of <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />, but stay tuned! Additional releases are on the way in the Summer of 2017, Spring of 2018, and beyond that will both return previous modeling capabilities, and provide new capabilities to make the fuels planning process easier and more efficient. </p>

            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>IBM will continue work on the Landscape and Model Comparison Dashboard, Landfire Lookup tables and implementation and integration of the user support resources. Ongoing work on Landscape editing and User Interface will continue through the holidays. The RD&amp;A IFTDSS team will be meeting with IBM to refine requirements for the first option year of the contract to include the Fuels Treatment Effectiveness Monitoring Database and the Quantitative Risk framework.</p>

                <p>This week the IBM development team is hard at work on improving the user interface and implementing standards for color, font and incorporation of logos. Bugs and enhancements were identified by the IFTDSS team and IBM is addressing these in priority order. A new "Home" page is being constructed so after a user logs in, there are options for navigation of the application depending on the users specific need.</p>

            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>The IFTDSS and IBM teams are identifying user support resources to integrate into the new application. Links to in-application help content are being established and new content is being developed. The IBM team will begin the “backend” coding to allow users to generate LANDFIRE EVT, EVH and EVC vegetation layers. Final touches are being put on the outputs for running fire behavior across the landscape (Flammap) in the model playground. Work will begin on the fuels treatment comparison dashboard.</p>

                <p>The IFTDSS team is hard at work for the next few weeks outlining and building the online user support structure as well as designing a logo and mapping out the look and feel of the application. Testing of the system is ongoing and developing requirements for the next iteration is underway. The team is providing feedback to IBM on the functionality that is currently available. The IBM team is busy coding the edit landscape feature in the Map Studio and designing a system for users to compare their model outputs pre and post treatment.</p>

                <p>IFTDSS team is testing functionality for the new Map Studio, Landscape Evaluation which is similar to Landscape critique in WFDSS and the ability to view Flammap Basic outputs on the Map. IBM will be working on a new set of requirements beginning 10/10 including building Landscape editing tools, creating a fuels treatment comparison dashboard, enhancements to the Map Studio and the beginning of a tool using Landfire lookup tables to help guide a user when changing fuel models.</p>
