        <h1>Develop Project Objectives for Landscape Evaluation</h1>
        <p class="comment" MadCap:conditions="General.DeveloperNotes">Will add content here when it is ready in the application - JH [UIdaho]</p>
        <p>Every project and treatment has goals and objectives.  It is important that these objectives are documented and referenced throughout the planning process.</p>
        <p>The Document Project Objectives functionality will help you stay on the right course in the planning phase of your project and reference back to objectives during the monitoring and reporting phases.</p>
        <p>Fuels treatment project objectives are often associated with reducing fire spread rates and intensities through vegetation changes, including the surface fuel model.</p>
        <p>Currently, these capabilities in IFTDSS are limited to fire behavior modeling, but future versions will expand these capabilities to address additional objectives and desired outcomes.</p>
