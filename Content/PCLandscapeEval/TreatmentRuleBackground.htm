        <h1>Treatment Rule Background</h1>
        <p>In <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> you may choose to edit your landscape using your own custom rules, or default rules meant to replicate landscape treatments or disturbances. The default rules often have additional options that specify the severity or breadth of the treatment or disturbance. Below we have outlined the details describing the specific treatment or disturbance details associated with each default rule:</p>

                <p><b>Thin 20% of all species for all size classes: Pile burn</b> - Understory thinning treatment that thins the stand to 80% of current density for all diameters. Thinned material is treated by pile burning 70% of the area and 80% of the fuel collected. Twenty percent additional mortality is expected in small diameter size classes due to thinning, piling, and burning. LANDFIRE vegetation disturbance codes 311, 312, and 313.</p>
                <p><b>Thin 65% of all species for all size classes: Pile burn</b> - Understory thinning treatment that thins the stand to 35% of current density for all diameters. Thinned material is treated by pile burning 70% of the area and 80% of the fuel collected. Twenty percent additional mortality is expected in small diameter size classes due to thinning, piling, and burning. LANDFIRE vegetation disturbance codes 321, 322, and 323.</p>

                <p><b>Thin 55% of all material &lt;6” DBH: lop and scatter</b> - Understory thinning treatment that cuts 55% of all material &lt; 6 inches in diameter and leaves it on site. Thinned material is treated by lopping and scattering. LANDFIRE&#160;vegetation disturbance codes 211, 212, and 213.</p>
                <p><b>Thin 75% of all material &lt;6” DBH; masticate ground fuels</b> - Understory thinning treatment that cuts 75% of all material &lt; 6 inches in diameter and leaves it on site. Thinned material is treated by mastication. LANDFIRE&#160;vegetation disturbance codes 221, 222, and 223.</p>
                <p><b>Thin 90% of all material &lt;8” DBH; masticate ground fuels</b> - Understory thinning treatment that cuts 90% of all material &lt; 8 inches in diameter and leaves it on site. Thinned material is treated by mastication. LANDFIRE&#160;vegetation disturbance codes 231, 232, and 233.</p>

                <p><b>Low severity fire</b> - Low severity wildfire or prescribed burn in natural fuels. Forty-five percent of the area is burned under wet moisture conditions with a 5 mph east, north-east wind (70 degrees). Tree mortality ranges from 1-24%.
