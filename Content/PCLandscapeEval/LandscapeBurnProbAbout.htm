        <h1>Calculating Burn Probability for Landscape Evaluation</h1>
        <p class="comment" MadCap:conditions="General.DeveloperNotes">Content will we added here when its ready in the application- JH [UIdaho]</p>
        <p>Landscape burn probability calculations will be available in a future version of <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />. These outputs will be useful to evaluate the relative likelihood and conditional intensity of fire across a given landscape under approximated worst case conditions (97th percentile fuel moisture and wind).  

</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The Relative Likelihood will be useful for identifying locations of higher burn probability across your landscape. 

</li>
            <li>The Conditional Intensity will be useful to see where higher burn probabilities are coupled with higher burn intensities to better understand hazard.  Outputs will be available as maps, graphs, and tables.  

</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="notificationNote"><p>Landscape Burn Probability will provide the expected distribution of fire across the landscape that incorporates both modeled fire behavior and modeled fire spread, whereas Landscape Fire Behavior currently provides modeled expected fire behavior, at any given point on the landscape.</p>
