        <p>In <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName"></MadCap:variable> you will encounter several terms that are applicable to <a href="../10-MapStudio/Files/ShapefileInfo.htm" target="_blank">shapefiles</a> (areas of interest). These terms all describe shapefiles, but are worded differently in different tasks to reflect the terminology common to those tasks in the wildland fire community. Here is a brief overview of how these terms are used in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName"></MadCap:variable>.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/mapstudio/masks.png" alt="A valley with three polygons in which treatments are indicated with differing colors" style="width: 341px;height: 280px;float: right;padding-left: 5px;">

        <h2>Area of Interest and Landscape Mask</h2>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">Area of Interest</span> indicates that you can select a shapefile to constrain your modeling or analysis to a specific area, such as a treatment unit. This term is used in the Landscape Summary task and Determining Treatment Alternatives task.</p>
        <p>In the Editing Landscape task, you will also see the term <span class="Emphasis">Landscape Mask</span> used. Landscape Mask will constrain your edits to a specific area.</p>
        <p>While we use different terms, <span class="Emphasis">Area of Interest</span> and <span class="Emphasis">Landscape Mask</span> function in the same way. Consider for example a scenario with a landscape called ‘Shady Basin’ and a treatment unit designated by a shapefile ‘Unit A’. In Editing, you would select Shady Basin as your landscape, and use Landscape Mask dropdown menu to constrain your edits to ‘Unit A’. In modeling fire behavior, you would select your edited landscape, and use the Area of Interest dropdown menu to constrain your modeling to Unit A.</p>
        <h2>Shapefile, Polygon, and Mask</h2>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">Shapefile</span>, <span class="Emphasis">Shape</span>, <span class="Emphasis">Polygon</span>, and <span class="Emphasis">Mask</span> are used in Map Studio to refer to shapefiles.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="Emphasis">Shapes:Masks</span>: is used in the Layer List button to indicate shapefiles.</li>
            <li><span class="Emphasis">Shapefile</span>: Is used in the Shapefile Upload button.</li>
            <li><span class="Emphasis">Polygons</span>: Is used in the Create/Edit Shapes button.</li>
        </ul>
