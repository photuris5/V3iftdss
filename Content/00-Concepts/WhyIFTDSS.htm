        <h1>Why Use <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> for Fuels Planning?</h1>
        <p>The <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> online application is being designed to make the fuels planning, analysis and management process more efficient  by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Providing a web-based platform for users to develop, store, edit and access fuels planning projects, landscapes, data and analyses, from any computer, anywhere.</li>
            <li>Integrating many common fire behavior and fire effects models in a single user interface.</li>
            <li>Linking to common reporting databases to more easily access, view and submit fuels planning information.</li>
            <li>Enabling users to develop fuels planning scenarios and comparisons and export  results, reports, tables, and files for use in fuels planning documentation or use for further analysis and collaboration.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Over the span of 2017, 2018, and beyond, additional capabilities will be added to <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> with the goal of eventually offering all the tools needed by the fire management community to conduct fuels planning and related analysis.</p>
