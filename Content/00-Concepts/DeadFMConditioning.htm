        <h1>Dead Fuel Moisture Conditioning</h1>
        <p>Fuel moisture conditioning is used to represent some of the variations in fuel moisture across your landscape. There are three choices for this:</p>
        <h2>Fixed</h2>
        <p>The fixed option applies the same fuel moisture (that you specified in the Fuel Moisture box) to the entire landscape. It does not account for variations i topography or shading.</p>
        <h2>IFTDSS Weather Stream</h2>
        <p>This option accounts for variation in topography, shading, and weather, across a period of time that you specify. The topography and shading values are inferred from your lcp file. Specifically, elevation slope and aspect are used for topography and canopy cover for shading. Weather data<span style="background-color: #ffff00;"> is taken from......</span></p>
        <h2>Upload My Own Weather Stream</h2>
        <p>This option accounts for variation in topography, shading, and weather, across a period of time that you specify. Available weather file <span style="background-color: #ffff00;">formats include........</span></p>
        <p>When using either of these latter conditioning methods, it is important to consider the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use a time period that best matches your scenario. <span style="background-color: #ffff00;">For example</span></li>
            <li>Conditioning periods only need to be 3-5 days long at maximum.</li>
            <li>Live fuel or foliar moistures are not modified when using the Fuel Moisture Conditioning options.</li>
        </ul>
