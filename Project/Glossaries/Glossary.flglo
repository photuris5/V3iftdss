- The finest level of detail is described by subregions, called sections, which are subdivisions of provinces based on terrain features.

- Also identified are mountainous areas that exhibit different ecological zones based on elevation. 

Ecoregions are: Tundra, subarctic, warm continental, hot continental, subtropical, prairie, marine, Mediterranean, tropical/subtropical steppe desert, tropical/subtropical desert, temperate steppe, temperate desert, savanna, and rainforest.</Definition>

The process for the creation of these winds is adiabatic warming of air that dropped its moisture on the windward side of the mountain. Föhn winds can raise air temperatures dramatically (30°C/54°F) in just a few hours and can contribute to the rapid spread of wildland fires. These winds are known by different names in different places around the world. The Santa Ana winds of southern California are similar, though they are are katabatic winds that originate in dry deserts.</Definition>

      Link="">A component of IFTDSS intended to guide users through different stages of the landscape planning process using IFTDSS. 

The stages of the cycle correspond to stages in the fuels planning process, proceeding through each stage will help you to more easily identify affected lands and establish fuels management objectives.  Selecting any stage of the Planning Cycle will bring up a series of ordered tasks associated with that stage. For example, by selecting the Landscape Evaluation stage, you are presented with options to create landscape, evaluate and edit landscape features (such as fuel models) for accuracy, and run basic models to view fire behavior and prioritize areas on the landscape for treatment.</Definition>

    <Definition
      Link="">Hydrolic unit codes (HUC) divides the United States into successively smaller units designated by codes. The first level of classification divides the nation into 21 major areas that contain the drainage area for a major river or series of rivers such as those draining into the Gulf of Mexico. The second level of classification divides the 21 regions into 221 subregions that contain the area drained by a river system, a basin or a group of streams forming a coastal drainage area. The third and fourth level of classification further subdivides the larger units into successively smaller drainage areas. Units are sometimes called “watersheds”.</Definition>
