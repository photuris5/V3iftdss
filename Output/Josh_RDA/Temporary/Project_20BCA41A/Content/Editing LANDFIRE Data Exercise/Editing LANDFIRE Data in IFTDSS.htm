        <p>Editing LANDFIRE Data in IFTDSS</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>LANDFIRE data are designed to be a course scale satellite-derived national dataset. Due to recent disturbance mechanisms such as fire, windthrow, beetle, drought and disease outbreak, as well as management activities, LANDFIRE data may not reflect well the actual fuel conditions in your project area. Consequently, LANDFIRE data may need to be edited to better reflect the local conditions within your project area, principally to reflect anticipated fire behavior. Additionally, as fuel treatments are simulated LANDFIRE data will need to be edited to reflect post-treatment conditions. Editing a LANDFIRE data set is much easier and faster than developing a landscape data file from scratch.</p>

        <p>Creating a Landscape Exercise 1</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Before editing a landscape you must first create a landscape to edit in IFTDSS.</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 36pt;" start="1">
            <li>Log into IFTDSS</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Select the Map Studio tab from the top of the page.</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 36pt;" start="2">
            <li>Select Landscape Tools <img src="../Resources/Images/Editing LANDFIRE Data Exercise/Editing LANDFIRE Data in IFTDSS.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;width: 21px;height: 21px;" alt="Macintosh HD:Users:DMindar:Desktop:Screen Shot 2017-10-31 at 8.37.09 AM.png" /> from the tool tray at the bottom of the screen. The Landscape Tools box appears.</li>
            <li>Click Create New Tab at the top right of the box.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Landscape tools will provide you two options for creating a landscape. </p>

        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 36pt;" start="4">
            <li>Use the Bounding Boxes.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; It is best to backspace all of the zeros and decimal point out and start fresh entering digits and decimal points. Be sure to use the negative symbol in front of your east and west coordinates. </p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 36pt;" start="5">
            <li>Enter the following coordinates in the respective boxes</li>
        </ol>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;margin-left: 72pt;">
            <li> North: 40.1025 </li>

        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 36pt;" start="6">
            <li>Select LANDFIRE 2014 from the dropdown menu.</li>
            <li>Select the default Fuel Model 40</li>
            <li>Enter an appropriate landscape name. I used the name “Grassy Valley”</li>
            <li>The Work Folder should have defaulted to Playground. Click the plus icon next to the box and create a New Folder. Name the folder appropriately. I used the name “Landscape Edits”. This folder is where your newly created landscape will reside.&#160; Your Landscape tools box should look similar to the example below. (figure 1)</li>
        </ol>

When you click the “Create” button, you should get the blue “Landscape Grassy Valley submitted. Check status under Add To Map tab or on your workspace view” dialog at the top of the box.</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 36pt;" start="11">
            <li>Scroll back to the top of the box and select the Add to map tab. </li>

If the checkbox is grayed and it says not created, it means the system is still processing your request so be patient. You will need to click the Refresh button in the upper right to refresh the status. Once it is ready click on the checkbox to the left of the name and IFTDSS will display your landscape and zoom you into it. (See Figure 2 below)</p>

This report gives you detail information on your landscape. Scroll through the report. Because this is a flat grass landscape, some of the landscape characteristics will have no data. If you scroll to fuel model, you will see your landscape is composed of three fuel models but is mostly GR2, which is a grass fuel model, a low load dry climate grass to be exact. </p>

        <p>Editing the Landscape Exercise 1</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>In this first exercise, you're going to make a simple edit to this landscape you just created to simulate a prolonged drought. You’re going to change the GR2 to a GR1, which is a short, sparse, dry climate grass.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 54pt;" start="1">
            <li>Return to your browser tab that has My Workspace open. </li>
            <li>Select your landscape and choose Edit. The Edit Landscape page will appear. The starting landscape has defaulted to your new landscape, however you could choose others from the drop-down box. You may choose to click on the map/arrow symbol <img src="../Resources/Images/Editing LANDFIRE Data Exercise/Editing LANDFIRE Data in IFTDSS_6.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;width: 28px;height: 16px;" alt="Macintosh HD:Users:DMindar:Desktop:Screen Shot 2018-02-16 at 3.26.15 PM.png" /> at the top of the page and split your view so you can see both the editing page and the map with your landscape displayed in one view.</li>

            <li>Where these conditions exist click, add a row. </li>
            <li>From the Attribute spinner box choose Fuel Model. </li>
            <li>From the Operator box choose is equal to. </li>
            <li>From the Value box choose 102(GR2). </li>

You may remember from using the identify tool that fuel model 102 comprises the majority of the landscape. </p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 54pt;" start="8">
            <li>Move down to modify the following values and click add row. </li>

        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 54pt;" start="12">
            <li>Enter a Name for the new edited landscape you are about to create. </li>

        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 54pt;" start="15">
            <li>Open your project folder and click on the name of the new landscape and choose Request a Report. </li>

If you remember your original landscape was mostly GR2 so this tells you that your edit was effective changing GR2 to GR1. </p>

        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 36pt;" start="1">
            <li>Select the Cycle tab from the top of the page. </li>
            <li>Choose the Strategic Planning pedal from the right side of the cycle wheel. </li>
            <li>Select Develop Treatment Alternatives box from the right of the wheel. </li>
            <li>Select your newly created landscape from the Select Landscape Box. </li>
            <li>Choose Cruches Basin Wilderness for the Area of Interest You may generate or open a landscape report or view your landscape in the “Map Studio” by choosing the buttons to the right<img src="../Resources/Images/Editing LANDFIRE Data Exercise/Editing LANDFIRE Data in IFTDSS_10.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;width: 57px;height: 19px;" alt="Macintosh HD:Users:DMindar:Desktop:Screen Shot 2017-11-01 at 3.48.44 PM.png" />. </li>
            <li>Select the Edit Landscape tab.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; You will notice this is the same interface you used to edit the other landscape.</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 36pt;" start="7">
            <li>Choose Cruches Basin as your starting landscape and choose Add User Created Edit Rule.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Assume fuels represented by TU1 161 are aspen stands that recently experienced high mortality particularly on the dry south-facing slopes. The aspen stands on the southerly aspects now have many jackstrawed dead down logs that are dry enough to burn.</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 36pt;" start="8">
            <li>Select add a row and choose Fuel Model for the Attribute select is equal to for the Operator and 161 (TU1) for the Value. </li>
            <li>Add another row and select Aspect for Attribute and is greater than or equal to for the Operator and 113 degrees for the value. </li>
            <li>Add one more row and choose Aspect again, choose is less than or equal to for the Operator and 292 for the value. </li>
        </ol>
        <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; This will cause the editor to find all cells that are fuel model 161 (TU1) and are on an aspect between 113 and 292 degrees. </p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 36pt;" start="11">
            <li>Go down to Modify the following values and add a row and choose Canopy Cover choose multiply by for Modifier and add a value of 0.65. </li>
        </ol>
        <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; This will reduce canopy cover for cells that meet the above criterion by 35% to simulate the loss of standing live trees. Canopy cover will affect midflame wind speeds. </p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 36pt;" start="12">
            <li>Add another row and choose Fuel Model choose set to for the Modifier and 184 (TL4) for the Value. </li>
        </ol>
        <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; This will change the cells that meet the above criterion to fuel model 184 (TL4), which are small downed logs. You may consider modifying canopy bulk density as well, but this is at low value already, and we are not concerned that live aspen crowns will burn. If crown fire were a concern, then this value should be edited as well. </p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 36pt;" start="13">
            <li>Choose Cruches Basin for Landscape Mask. </li>
        </ol>
        <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Because we are only concerned with Cruches Basin Wilderness, we are going to choose Cruches Basin Wilderness as a Landscape Mask. This will limit the edits to the wilderness area only. </p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 36pt;" start="14">
            <li>Select Add to Rules. </li>
        </ol>
        <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; You will see your new rule added to Landscape Edit Rule list above. You may notice the editor has changed the order of your rows, but the important thing is, does the rule language make sense? </p>

        <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; You may choose to look at the landscape report for your newly edited landscape as you did in first part of this exercise to see if the edits were applied as expected. To do this, you will need to leave the Develop Treatment Alternatives workspace go to My Workspace and open your working folder. Find your edited landscape and click on it and choose Request a Report. When the report has completed, open it and scroll to fuel model. If the report is not open for the unedited landscape open it as well. If you compare the two reports, you will see your new edited landscape now has the TL4 fuels you created in the edit session. The TL4 does not make up a significant portion of the landscape but does constitute over 1,000 acres. </p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 36pt;" start="15">
            <li>Return to the Develop Treatment Alternatives workspace by selecting the Cycle tab, </li>
            <li>Choose the Strategic Planning pedal on the cycle wheel. </li>
            <li>Choose Develop Treatment Alternatives from the right. </li>
            <li>Select Cruches Basin again from the Select Landscape drop-down box. </li>
        </ol>
        <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Once you select your landscape you will be right back in your work session. </p>
        <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Now you will look at a different report but to access this report we’re going to need to run fire behavior modeling. </p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 36pt;" start="19">
            <li>Click the Model Input tab on the Develop Treatment Alternatives page. You may enter any model inputs you choose; I entered the following then save your inputs. (See Figure 6)</li>
        </ol>

        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 36pt;" start="20">
            <li>Select the Run Model tab and run fire behavior for both landscapes. This may take a few minutes to complete. You can use the Run Status refresh button <img src="../Resources/Images/Editing LANDFIRE Data Exercise/Editing LANDFIRE Data in IFTDSS_13.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;width: 21px;height: 15px;" alt="Macintosh HD:Users:DMindar:Desktop:Screen Shot 2017-11-06 at 9.24.58 AM.png" />to check the status of the runs. </li>
            <li> After the runs are complete, select the Compare Alternatives tab and place a checkmark in the box left of both landscapes by clicking in the boxes. </li>
            <li>Choose the Compare in Summary Report a Treatment Alternatives Summary Compare Report dialog box will pop up. Choose the Create Report to the right of Landscape Compare Summary Report. When the report has completed open it.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; This report compares the two landscapes side by side. From the first graph, you can see fuel model TL4 is present on your edited landscape but not on the original landscape. (See Figure 7) You will also see that TU1 has changed between the two landscapes. (See Figure 8) This confirms that your edits moved some of the TU1 to TL4. As you scroll down the other tables and charts, confirm this. The percent difference chart is particularly useful for displaying the changes made. (See Figure 9)</p>

        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Look at the Canopy Cover charts and tables. Do these reflect the edits you made to the canopy cover? </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>

        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>This report is very powerful. Individual sections can be exported in various formats for written reports or printed, and data can be exported in CSV or Excel format for further analysis or display with other graphs or tables.&#160; </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Editing LANDFIRE Data Exercise/Editing LANDFIRE Data in IFTDSS_17.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;width: 205px;height: 27px;" alt="Macintosh HD:Users:DMindar:Desktop:Screen Shot 2017-11-08 at 12.39.10 PM.png" />
        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Look at the Fire Behavior Compare Summary report. What changes did this single edit make to the fire behavior on the landscape? Does this make sense changing from a grass-shrub model to logs over a small portion of the landscape? </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>This concludes the exercise, but feel free to explore and use your new skills to try other landscape edits. IFTDSS also has default fuel treatment and disturbance based edit rules that can be used to edit your landscape.</p>
