        <p>About Summary Reports</p>
        <p>IFTDSS generates 4 types of summary reports which can be requested from various places throughout the application.&#160; All reports can be retrieved and viewed from My Workspace.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;margin-left: 36pt;">
            <li>Auto 97th Summary Report: Summarizes both landscape attributes and a default landscape fire behavior run conducted under 97th percentile weather conditions.&#160; This report can only be created from the Landscape Summary task in Landscape Evaluation portion of the Cycle.</li>
            <li>Landscape (LCP) Summary Report: (Landscape Input File Attribute Summary) This report contains only landscape attributes and&#160; can be created from the landscape file in My Workspace.</li>
            <li>Model Run Output&#160; Report : (Fire Behavior Outputs Summary, discussed in a later tutorial).&#160; This report can be created from the list of&#160; Model Output files in My Workspace.</li>
            <li>Comparison Reports:&#160; Fire behavior and landscape attribute report comparing two landscapes and two model output files.&#160; These reports can only be created from the Develop Treatment Alternatives task within Strategic Planning of the Cycle. (We will look at these in a later tutorial)</li>
        </ul>

        </p>
        <p>Report Types are symbolized in My Workspace with a Bar Chart icon <img src="../Resources/Images/Tutorial 3 Creating Summary Reports/Creating Summary Reports_1.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;width: 21px;height: 20px;" />. You can click ‘Report’ under the Display heading of the left hand panel to filter and display only reports within a given folder. Hovering over the Report name in the workspace tells more about the report. </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Tutorial 3 Creating Summary Reports/Creating Summary Reports_2.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;width: 335px;height: 114px;border-top-style: solid;border-top-width: 1pt;border-bottom-style: solid;border-bottom-width: 1pt;border-left-style: solid;border-left-width: 1pt;border-right-style: solid;border-right-width: 1pt;" />
        </p>
        <p>Any type of report can be viewed from My Workspace by clicking on the report name, then clicking the View Summary button. Clicking on a landscape or Model Output in My Workspace and using the Request a Report button, will generate a LCP report or Model Run Output report.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>In this tutorial you will generate an Auto97th Summary report, and an LCP report. We will follow up by showing where you may generate a Model Run Output report, and Comparison report, but will not outline those steps here because they are addressed in a later tutorial.</p>

        <p>Creating an Auto97th Summary Report</p>
        <p>An Auto-97th summary report provides a quick fire behavior model run summary under severe weather conditions for a given location. Fuel moistures are automatically populated using the 97th percentile weather conditions recorded at the nearest vetted Remote Automated Weather Station (RAWS) to the center point of your landscape extent. </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>If you have navigated away from the Landscape Summary interface, it can be accessed from the Cycle, using the Landscape Evaluation stage of the planning cycle.</p>

            <li>Specify an existing landscape to summarize using the dropdown menu. If your following along with the Haypress landscape example you may use that one, or choose one of your own landscapes.</li>
            <li>If you wanted to constrain the summary to a specific area of interest, you could choose a shapefile from the Area of Interest dropdown. Leave this option blank for this example, this will result in a summary report that covers the entire landscape. </li>
            <li>Click the Request a Report button.<img src="../Resources/Images/Tutorial 3 Creating Summary Reports/Creating Summary Reports_5.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;width: 424px;height: 182px;" /></li>
            <li>A prompt appears with the name of your landscape across the top. Click Create Report to generate the Summary Report.</li>

It may take a couple minutes to generate.</p>

        </p>
        <p>When complete, your Summary Report will become an active hyperlink, and a green checkmark will appear next to it. Clicking it from this confirmation dialogue box will open the report. Later, as you navigate through&#160;IFTDSS, you will be able to view this report again from&#160;My Workspace, in the same folder as your landscape.</p>

            <img src="../Resources/Images/Tutorial 3 Creating Summary Reports/Creating Summary Reports_10.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;width: 630px;height: 148px;" alt="click the report link to open it" />
        </p>
        <p>Click the Report link. The report will open in a separate browser tab. Give it a brief overview to become familiar with its layout. </p>

        </p>
        <p>Note the landscape data and model run parameters outlined along the top, the map, table, bar, and pie charts available for the landscape and behavior outputs, and the ability to jump to a specific output using the left-hand menu. When finished, click the download icon in the top-right, and download a pdf to your computer’s hard-drive. The download button will download the entire report. </p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>You will also notice download options next to individual report pieces that allow you to copy or save just that part of the report. These are found in the top right for charts, and along the left for tables.</p>
        <p>When finished, close the report tab and go back to IFTDSS.</p>
        <p>Creating a Landscape (LCP) Summary Report</p>
        <p>You just looked at a report combining Auto97th fire behavior and landscape attributes, but there may be times when you are just interested in a summary of landscape attributes. This is when the Landscape (LCP) Summary Report is useful. To generate one:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Tutorial 3 Creating Summary Reports/Creating Summary Reports_13.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;width: 672px;height: 246px;border-top-style: solid;border-top-width: 1pt;border-bottom-style: solid;border-bottom-width: 1pt;border-left-style: solid;border-left-width: 1pt;border-right-style: solid;border-right-width: 1pt;" />
        </p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;margin-left: 36pt;" start="1">
            <li>Navigate to My Workspace.</li>
            <li>Open your project folder.</li>
            <li>Select your landscape by clicking on it.</li>
            <li>Click the Request a Report button.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Take a few minutes to familiarize yourself with the landscape report before continuing to the next tutorial.</p>
