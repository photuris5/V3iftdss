        <h2 class="Heading2">About Shapefiles in IFTDSS:</h2>
        <p>Shapefiles are used in IFTDSS to constrain your area when representing treatment alternatives, making landscape edits, or running landscape comparisons. In this tutorial you will create a shapefile directly within Map Studio, but there is also an option to upload your own shapefiles from within Map Studio by using the Shapefile Upload button.</p>
        <p>Throughout IFTDSS interface you will encounter several terms that refer to shapefiles. Different terms are used in different tasks to reflect the terminology common in the wildland fire community. Here is a brief explanation of where the different terms are used throughout IFTDSS.</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;margin-left: 36pt;">
            <li>Area of Interest: This term is used in the Landscape Summary task and Determining Treatment Alternatives task to constrain the area of your analysis.</li>
            <li>Landscape Mask: This term is used in Landscape Editing to constrain the area your edits apply to.</li>
            <li>Polygon, Shape, or Shapefile: These terms are used interchangeably throughout Map Studio.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To simulate and evaluate the impact of treatments, we'll delineate our planned treatment areas with shapefiles in&#160;Map Studio.</p>
        <table>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>
                        <p>Tutorial Information: If you are following along using the Haypress Creek example use that landscape in Map Studio, and be sure to save your shapefiles in the Haypress Creek Project folder. You may use the below screen capture to see approximately where the polygons are located, and look at the images below to create similar polygons, they do not need to be an exact match.</p>

        <h2 class="Heading2">Creating Shapefiles in Map Studio to represent treatment polygons</h2>
        <p>For this example you will create and combine three treatment areas for a landscape called Haypress Creek, but you may follow along using your own landscape if desired. We’ll draw three polygons in the area around Sierra City that correspond to wildland urban interface, and significant fire behavior. </p>
        <p>To draw your polygons:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Create_shapes/Creating Shapefiles_1.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;width: 672px;height: 465px;" />
        </p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;margin-left: 36pt;" start="1">
            <li>Open&#160;Create/Edit Shapes&#160;<img src="../Resources/Images/Create_shapes/Creating Shapefiles_2.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;width: 15px;height: 15px;" alt="create edit shapes button" /></li>
            <li>Select your method, in this case the Freehand Draw method.</li>
            <li>Draw your polygon on the landscape by holding down the left mouse button and releasing when finished. Repeat steps B and C here and draw two more polygons. Note you can use the&#160;delete button&#160;<img src="../Resources/Images/Create_shapes/Creating Shapefiles_3.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;width: 15px;height: 15px;" alt="delete button" />to remove the polygon if you are not satisfied with it. </li>
            <li>Name your polygons, in this example we’ve named them “Haypress Treatments All”.</li>
            <li>Specify the folder you would like to save the shapefile in.</li>
            <li>Click Create.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Once you click create polygons will change from highlighted yellow to a purple shaded outline on the map as shown below.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Create_shapes/Creating Shapefiles_4.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;width: 624px;height: 297px;border-top-style: solid;border-top-width: 1pt;border-bottom-style: solid;border-bottom-width: 1pt;border-left-style: solid;border-left-width: 1pt;border-right-style: solid;border-right-width: 1pt;" alt="a zoomed view of the three treatment pologygons to the north and east of the wui" />
        </p>
        <p>Saved shapefiles are available in&#160;My Workspace&#160;in the folder you selected (in this case the Haypress Creek project folder). Shapefiles can be deleted by going into My Workspace, selecting the shapefile, and clicking Delete.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Create_shapes/Creating Shapefiles_5.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;width: 644px;height: 69px;" />
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Create_shapes/Creating Shapefiles_6.png" style="z-index: 1;visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;mso-wrap-distance-left: 9pt;mso-wrap-distance-top: 9pt;mso-wrap-distance-right: 9pt;mso-wrap-distance-bottom: 9pt;mso-position-horizontal: absolute;mso-position-horizontal-relative: margin;mso-position-vertical: absolute;mso-position-vertical-relative: text;margin-left: 241.5pt;width: 336px;height: 311px;" />
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>All shapefiles for an available area are visible by default in Map Studio. To hide individual shapefiles, use the Filter button <img src="../Resources/Images/Create_shapes/Creating Shapefiles_7.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;width: 15px;height: 15px;" alt="filter button" />  in the top right of Map Studio</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Now that you have an area of interest, you can constrain your analysis area to represent treatments, or use it to generate more focused summary reports. Take a few minutes to generate a Landscape/Auto97th Summary report, this time, specify the Area of Interest using the newly created shapefile. Take a second to look at the differences in this new report, compared to the one generated for the entire landscape:</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;margin-left: 36pt;" start="1">
            <li>Navigate back to the&#160;Planning Cycle&#160;using the top navigation menu.</li>
        </ol>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;margin-left: 36pt;" start="2">
            <li>Select the&#160;Landscape Evaluation&#160;stage of the Planning Cycle.</li>
        </ol>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;margin-left: 36pt;" start="3">
            <li>Click the&#160;Landscape Summary&#160;task.<img src="../Resources/Images/Create_shapes/Creating Shapefiles_9.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;width: 672px;height: 256px;border-top-style: solid;border-top-width: 1pt;border-bottom-style: solid;border-bottom-width: 1pt;border-left-style: solid;border-left-width: 1pt;border-right-style: solid;border-right-width: 1pt;" /></li>
            <li>Select your Landscape from the dropdown menu</li>
            <li>Select your Area of Interest from the dropdown menu. Any shapes that fall within your chosen landscapes area of interest, will be available from this menu.</li>
            <li>Click Request a Report and follow the prompts to create report.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>When your report is complete, take a couple minutes to open it and review the results. Note that:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Create_shapes/Creating Shapefiles_10.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;width: 671px;height: 327px;border-top-style: solid;border-top-width: 1pt;border-bottom-style: solid;border-bottom-width: 1pt;border-left-style: solid;border-left-width: 1pt;border-right-style: solid;border-right-width: 1pt;" />
        </p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;margin-left: 36pt;" start="1">
            <li>Your area of interest is displayed on the map, and described in the legend</li>
            <li>Your area of interest and acreage is now listed in the top output description under the results listed for tables description.</li>
        </ol>
