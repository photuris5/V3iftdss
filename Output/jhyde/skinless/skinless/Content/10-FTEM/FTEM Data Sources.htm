        <h1>Data Sources Used by FTEM (An Overview)</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The Fuels Treatment Effectiveness Monitoring (FTEM) process relies on geospatial Integrated Point and Polygon Fuels Treatment Layers that depict completed fuels treatments from four land management Agencies within the Department of Interior (National Park Service, Bureau of Land Management, US Fish and Wildlife Service, and Bureau of Indian Affairs) as well as the US Forest Service.</p>
        <p>The FTEM Integrated Point and Polygon Fuels Treatment Layers are derived from data stored in:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">The Hazardous Fuels Reduction (HFR) Module of the National Fire Plan Operations and Reporting System (NFPORS). NFPORS is the national system for tracking combined fuels accomplishments for all agencies in the Department of Interior.</li>
            <li value="2">The Forest Service Activity Tracking System (FACTS). FACTS is the official system for tracking U.S. Forest Service fuels accomplishments. FACTS data is shared with NFPORS to facilitate interagency joint reporting needs.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Combining Data Sources</h2>
        <p>If FACTS data is shared with NFPORS, why not just use NFPORS data in FTEM?  As with many things geospatial, itâ€™s complicated.</p>
        <p>NFPORS contains both point and polygon fuels treatment data from the previously mentioned Agencies within the Department of Interior and point data only for fuels treatments from the U.S. Forest Service. Polygon data depicting fuels treatments from the U.S. Forest Service is stored in FACTS.</p>
        <p>Additionally, not all treatment records have an associated polygon due to variability in Agency-specific reporting rules and system capabilities. This is especially true for older treatments. However, all treatment records are represented by a point. Another complicating factor is that NFPORS and FACTS use different attributes to describe similar information related to fuels treatments.</p>
        <p>To overcome these challenges, the FTEM team created two fuels treatment layers, one point layer and one polygon layer. Together, these layers represent an integrated depiction of completed fuels treatments across five Federal Agencies. The FTEM Integrated Point and Polygon Fuels Treatment Layers:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">draw spatial and tabular information from both FACTS and NFPORS</li>
            <li value="2">contain attributes that are crosswalked to a common standard (see below for more detail on this process)</li>
            <li value="3">are automatically updated weekly* to reflect newly entered and revised data</li>
            <li value="4">are filtered to remove duplicate records, where possible</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Creating a Common Standard</h2>
        <p>Combining NFPORS and FACTS polygon data into the FTEM Integrated Point and Polygon Fuels Treatment Layers was accomplished by using the National Wildfire Coordinating Group (NWCG) data standard for fuels treatments to identify the minimum attributes required for fuels. NWCG standards provide specifications for data that enable common usage across wildland fire information systems (https://www.nwcg.gov/data-standards).  After thoroughly reviewing FACTS and NFPORS polygon data, the FTEM team crosswalked and combined the data from the respective systems.  This methodology includes a process to remove duplicate polygon records.</p>
        <p>The points within the FTEM Integrated Point and Polygon Fuels Treatment Layers are derived directly from NFPORS, as no NWCG data standard for fuels treatment points currently exists, although it has been slated for development. This layer is filtered to remove those points that are already represented by polygons in the FTEM Integrated Point and Polygon Fuels Layers.</p>
        <p>Inevitably, some duplication remains due to inconsistencies in how records are populated, but this integration is first of its kind. No other cross-agency, integrated polygon and point coverage of completed fuels treatments currently exists. For more detailed information on the process, please refer to the FTEM Fuels Treatment Data Technical Documentation.</p>
        <p>*After weekly automatic treatment data updates are monitored for success, updates may occur on a daily basis to better integrate with any changes users perform in the systems of record.</p>
