        <h1>Evaluate the landscape and edit it to reflect the current conditions on the ground using the Landscape Evaluation stage of the planning cycle</h1>
        <p>Now that we have our landscape, we can make edits if necessary so it reflects our landscapes existing condition as close as possible. For your own landscape, you’ll have your own editing to do, but for this hypothetical example, we’ll say that we want to reduce the canopy cover in all TU5 areas by 5%.</p>
        <div class="notificationImportant">
            <p><strong>Important!</strong> Be deliberate in the rules you apply when editing landscapes:</p>
            <p>Rules are applied based on the order in which you add them. Default Treatment/Disturbance rules are always applied <span class="Emphasis">first</span>, in the order you have assigned them, followed by User Created Edit rules in the order you have assigned them.</p>
            <p>After applying rules to a given landscape you should always validate that your changes have been made as you intended. <span class="Emphasis">If you are unsure of the effect of the rules you apply, consider saving a version of your landscape after each edit to allow for easy comparison of the changes made by each edit rule you apply</span>.</p>
            <p>For further detail see the <a href="../../30-Tasks/LndscpEdit/RuleOrdering.htm" target="_blank">Rule Ordering Considerations</a> and the <a href="../../30-Tasks/LndscpEdit/LandscapeEditTechTopic.htm" target="_blank">Rule Technical Documentation</a> Topics</p>

            <li value="2">View the Add User Created Edit Rule options by selecting the drop-down arrow to the far right of the <span class="UIcomponent">Add User&#160;Created Edit Rule</span> heading.</li>
            <li value="3">Specify the conditions you would like to select in the fields below <span class="UIcomponent">Where these conditions exist</span>. In this example we have selected "Fuel Model" as the Attribute, "is equal to" as the Operator and fire behavior fuel model "165 (TU5)" as the Value. This selected all TU5 fuel modeled areas across the landscape.</li>
            <li value="4">Specify the conditions you would like to change by populating the fields below <span class="UIcomponent">Modify the following values</span>. In this example we have selected "Canopy Cover" as the Attribute, "decrease by" as the Operator, and "5" (for 5 percent) as the Value. For all TU5 fuel modeled areas, the application decreases the canopy cover by 5 percent. </li>
            <li value="5">The <span class="UIcomponent">Apply to Landscape Mask</span> (optional) drop-down allows you to select a shapefile  these edits will be contained. We will leave this field blank, which will apply our edit to the entire landscape.</li>
            <li value="6">When you are ready to apply this rule click <span class="UIcomponent">Add to Rules</span>. Notice the rule has been added to the list, and the order noted. You can delete rules before saving by using the delete button <img src="../../Resources/Images/buttons_general/button_delete.png" alt="delete button" title="Image of the Delete Button" /> to the right of each rule. </li>

                    <p>Rules are applied top to bottom, first by Default Fuels Treatment / Disturbance Edit Rules then by user defined User Created Edit Rules.
