        <h1>Editing a Landscape to Develop Treatment Alternatives</h1>
        <p>Landscape Editing can occur in both the Landscape Evaluation stage of the Planning Cycle under<span class="UIcomponent"> Landscape Edit</span>, or within the Strategic Planning stage under Develop <span class="UIcomponent">Treatment Alternatives</span>. Menu options and results are the same for both. In editing sessions accessed from the Landscape Evaluation Section, any landscape can be edited. In editing sessions accessed from  the Develop Treatment Alternatives section only certain landscapes may be selected to ensure the comparison between landscapes of the same extent.</p>
        <p>In Developing Treatment Alternatives, your <a href="../../00-Concepts/AboutLandscapesinIFTDSS.htm#Originating_Landscape_(Zero_“0”_landscape)" target="_blank">Originating Landscape</a> must be an <a href="../../00-Concepts/AboutLandscapesinIFTDSS.htm#Extracted_Unedited_Landscape" target="_blank">Extracted, unedited LANDFIRE</a> landscape and the only landscapes available for you to edit must fall within the same landscape extent. </p>
        <h2>Getting Ready to Edit</h2>
        <p><span class="UIcomponent">Edit Landscape</span> will walk you through editing your landscape based on a default set of rules you select, or a custom set of rules you create. </p>
        <p>Here you will edit landscapes to either develop your Existing Condition (EC) if needed, create your treatment alternatives, or make adjustments to previously created landscapes that match the extent of your Originating Landscape. </p>
        <p>Whatever the case might be, it is very important to have an Existing Condition to ensure more accurate comparison results to gauge how each alternative does or does not meet objectives. The Existing Condition may need to reflect new disturbances on your landscape, like recent wildfires, fuels treatments, or windfalls.</p>
        <p>Below is an image of the editing interface. View a map of your area while editing by clicking the globe icon <img src="../../Resources/Images/buttons_general/button_showsplitmap.png" alt="split map" /> at the top left of the page. Rules you select will display at the top of the interface, in the order you select them.</p>

        <p>There are two methods available for making landscapes edits, we'll look at each one below:</p>

                    <p><strong>Important!</strong> Be deliberate in the rules you apply when editing landscapes:</p>
                    <p>Rules are applied based on the order in which you add them. Default Treatment/Disturbance rules are always applied <span class="Emphasis">first</span>, in the order you have assigned them, followed by User Created Edit rules in the order you have assigned them.</p>
                    <p>After applying rules to a given landscape you should always validate that your changes have been made as you intended. <span class="Emphasis">If you are unsure of the effect of the rules you apply, consider saving a version of your landscape after each edit to allow for easy comparison of the changes made by each edit rule you apply</span>.</p>

                </div>
                <p>Default Fuel Treatment / Disturbance Edit Rules use previously existing LANDFIRE Lookup tables (LFLU) and Fuel Model Lookup (FMLU) tables. The LFLU tables were created in an effort to improve the LANDFIRE fuels layers between versions. The LFLU tables are used to adjust the fuel attributes of cells, including fuel model, canopy cover, stand height, canopy base height, and canopy bulk density, based on the type and intensity of treatment or disturbance and the time that has elapsed since that treatment or disturbance. For more technical details on these rules, visit the <a href="../LndscpEdit/LandscapeEditTechTopic.htm" target="_blank">Default Edit Rule Technical Documentation Topic</a>.</p>
